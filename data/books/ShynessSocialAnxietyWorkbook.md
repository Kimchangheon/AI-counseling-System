### Acknowledgments

There are many people without whom this workbook would not have been possible.
First, we wish to acknowledge those who were instrumental in developing and investi-
gating the treatments described in this book. Dr. Aaron T. Beck pioneered many of the
cognitive strategies that are used throughout the world to treat anxiety, depression, and
many other conditions. We are also indebted to Drs. Isaac Marks, S. Rachman, Joseph
Wolpe, David Barlow, and others who helped to develop and study the exposure-based
strategies that are now commonplace for the treatment of anxiety. We also acknowledge
the important contributions of Drs. Richard Heimberg, Samuel Turner, Deborah Beidel,
David M. Clark, and others who adapted these cognitive and behavioral methods for the
treatment of social anxiety.
A special thank-you goes out to our colleagues, clients, and patients who provided
many helpful suggestions over the years that informed this second edition of _The Shyness
and Social Anxiety Workbook_. Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to the staff at New
Harbinger Publications (including Carole Honeychurch, Matthew McKay, Catharine
Sutker, Amy Shoup, Dorothy Smyk, and many others), who worked closely with us

### Introduction

Shyness and social anxiety are universal. From time to time, almost everyone has felt
nervous speaking in front of a group or anxious when interacting with another person.
We wonder if a presentation has gone well or whether we have made a good impression
on a first date or a job interview. In fact, even some celebrities, who make their living
in the public eye, have been described as excessively shy from time to time, including
Harrison Ford (actor), Mary Chapin Carpenter (singer), Michelle Pfeiffer (actor), David
Bowie (rock star), David Letterman (talk-show host), Nicole Kidman (actor), and Carrie
Underwood ( _American Idol_ winner). There have also been reports in the media about
musical performers like Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon, and Donny Osmond suffering
from performance anxiety. Even radio “shock jock” Howard Stern has described himself
as being painfully shy when he is outside the safe confines of his on-air studio. (FYI,
details on other shy celebrities can be found at [http://www.shakeyourshyness.com/shypeople](http://www.shakeyourshyness.com/shypeople)
.htm.)
Shyness and social anxiety can range in intensity from being fairly mild to completely
incapacitating. In extreme cases, social anxiety may prevent an individual from develop-
ing friendships, working, or even standing in a public place. Regardless of whether your
fears are minor or completely overwhelming, the strategies described in this book will
help you to deal more effectively with social anxiety.
We recommend that you read this workbook in the order in which the chapters
appear. The initial chapters are designed to educate you about the nature of social
anxiety and to teach you how to evaluate the main features of your own social anxiety.
Then we discuss the costs and benefits of different treatment approaches and help you to
select among available treatment options. Subsequent chapters provide detailed informa-
tion about particular treatment strategies including medications, cognitive therapy for
changing your anxious thoughts, using exposure to confront the situations you fear, and


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

fine-tuning your communication and performance skills. The final chapter of the book
discusses strategies for maintaining your improvements.
This book is different from other self-help books in a number of ways. Of the many
books on social anxiety and shyness that you will find in your local bookstore, this was
the first to be written in a workbook format. It is filled with exercises and practices
designed to teach you basic strategies for overcoming shyness and social anxiety. We
encourage you to fill in the blank worksheets and forms located throughout the text. In
addition, we encourage you to make copies of the forms for your personal use so you
can continue to use them over the coming months.
This book also differs from many others because the strategies we recommend have
all been investigated extensively in well-designed clinical studies. In addition to specializ-
ing in helping people deal more effectively with their anxiety, we also are actively involved
in research on the nature and treatment of anxiety. It is a well-established fact that when
the techniques described in this book are used in a therapeutic setting, people generally
experience a significant decrease in their social and performance anxiety (Rodebaugh,
Holaway, and Heimberg 2004). Essentially, we have taken strategies that have proven
to be useful in therapy and adapted them into a self-help format. Recently, investigators
have also shown that our self-help approach (using the first edition of this book) can
also be effective for reducing social anxiety (Moore, Braddock, and Abramowitz 2007).
This workbook is designed so that it can be used alone or coupled with regular visits to
a professional therapist. In fact, a motive for writing this book was to have a good refer-
ence our own clients and patients can use as they progress through therapy.
This second edition has been thoroughly updated with the latest scientific knowl-
edge and references concerning the nature and treatment of social anxiety (for example,
the section on the genetic underpinnings of social anxiety now includes a discussion
of the Human Genome Project, which hadn’t been completed when the first edition
was published). The chapter on medications has also been revised to include the latest
information on medications that have only recently been studied for treatment of social
anxiety. Sections that were previously unclear or out of date have been completely
rewritten. We have added many new examples and several forms and diaries have been
updated and simplified. New sections have been added as well, including a discussion
of strategies for improving motivation for treatment and sections for family members
and friends of people who suffer from social anxiety. Finally, the lists of recommended
readings and Internet resources have been thoroughly updated.
The journey to overcoming your shyness and social anxiety may not be an easy one.
Some aspects of your fear will be easier and quicker to overcome than others. Also,
for every two or three steps forward, you may experience what feels like a step back.
Nevertheless, the techniques described in this book have been shown to reduce social
and performance fears in most people who use them consistently. With hard work and
perseverance, these strategies will provide you with the opportunity to make big, posi-
tive changes in your life.


PART 1

### Understanding Your

### Social Anxiety



CHAPTER 1

### Shyness and Social Anxiety

Rachel was a twenty-six-year-old woman who worked as an assistant manager of a small
bookstore. She was referred to our Anxiety Treatment and Research Centre to get help
for intense anxiety about her upcoming wedding. Rachel wasn’t afraid of being married;
in fact, she looked forward to spending years together with her husband. She was terri-
fied of the wedding itself. The idea of being on display in front of such a large audience
was almost unthinkable. In fact, she had postponed her wedding twice before because
of her fear of being the center of attention.
Rachel’s anxiety involved more than just a fear of her wedding. She reported that
she’d always been shy, even when she was very young. When she was in high school,
her anxiety around people had become so intense that it was affecting her school life.
She was convinced that her classmates would find her dull or boring, or that they would
notice her anxiety and assume that she was incompetent. Typically, Rachel avoided doing
oral reports at school and didn’t take any classes where she felt her performance might be
observed or judged by her classmates (such as physical education). On a few occasions,
she even asked for special permission to hand in a written essay instead of doing a pre-
sentation in front of the class. Despite being an excellent student, she generally tended
to be very quiet in class and rarely asked questions or participated in class discussions.
Throughout college, Rachel found it difficult to make new friends. Although people
enjoyed her company and often invited her to parties and other social events, she rarely
accepted the invitations. She had a long list of excuses to get out of socializing with
other people. She was comfortable only with her family and a few longtime friends, but
aside from those, she usually avoided contact with other people.
After college, Rachel began working at a bookstore, and after a short time, she
was promoted to assistant manager. She was always comfortable dealing with custom-
ers at her store, and she gradually became more comfortable talking to her coworkers.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

However, she avoided eating lunch with other staff members, and she never attended
any social events, including the company’s annual holiday party.
Rachel lived with her social anxiety for years, despite how it interfered with her
education, work, and social life. It was not until the anxiety prevented her from having
the kind of wedding she and her fiancé wanted that she decided to seek help.
Rachel’s story is not that different from those of other people who experience
intense feelings of shyness, social anxiety, and performance-related fears. The types of
anxious beliefs and behaviors that she reported are similar to those that many socially
anxious people describe. After her evaluation at our center, Rachel began a twelve-
session course of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and gradually learned to cope with
her anxiety more effectively. By the end of treatment, her avoidance of social situations
had decreased significantly, and Rachel was much more comfortable in situations that
previously made her very anxious.
CBT involves (1) identifying the thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to
people’s negative feelings, such as anxiety, and (2) teaching people new ways of thinking
and behaving to better manage their anxiety. This book will teach you the strategies
commonly used in CBT for social anxiety. Before exploring those strategies, however, we
will begin this chapter in the same way we usually begin treatment with the individuals
we see in our program—with an overview of the nature of fear and anxiety in general,
and of social anxiety in particular.

ANXIETY, WORRY, FEAR, AND PANIC

Everyone knows what it feels like to be afraid. Fear is a basic human emotion. In humans,
fear is controlled, in part, by an area of the brain called the limbic system. The _limbic system_
includes some of the deepest, most primitive structures of the brain—structures shared
by many less “evolved” animals. In fact, there is reason to believe that the emotion of fear
is present across most, if not all, animal species. Most organisms display specific patterns
of behavior when confronted with danger and often these “fearful” behaviors include
forms of aggression or escape. Therefore, the intense feelings we experience when we are
exposed to an immediate danger often are called the “fight-or-flight” response.
Although most people use the terms “anxiety” and “fear” interchangeably, behav-
ioral scientists who study emotions assign somewhat different meanings to these and
other related terms (Barlow 2002; Suárez et al., in press). _Anxiety_ is a future-oriented
feeling of dread or apprehension associated with the sense that events are both uncon-
trollable and unpredictable. In other words, anxiety is a nagging feeling that occurs when
a person believes a negative event may occur in the future and that nothing can be done
to prevent it.
People who feel anxious tend to dwell upon and ruminate about the possibility of
danger. This tendency to dwell on future negative events is called worry. Anxiety is also
associated with uncomfortable physical feelings such as arousal (for example, sweatiness,
increased pulse), tension (for instance, tight muscles), and pain (like headaches).


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
There is no question that when anxiety is too intense it can interfere with perfor-
mance; however, mild to moderate amounts of anxiety are actually helpful. If you never
became even slightly anxious under any circumstances, you probably wouldn’t bother
doing the things that must be done. Why would you bother preparing an assignment on
time, dressing nicely for a date, or eating healthy food if you weren’t concerned about
the consequences of not doing these things? In part, it is anxiety that motivates us to
work hard, prepare for challenges, and protect ourselves from possible threats.
In contrast to anxiety, _fear_ is a basic emotion that occurs when an individual is con-
fronted with an immediate real or imagined danger. Fear leads to a sudden, intense
physiological alarm reaction that essentially has one purpose—to get the person away
from the danger as quickly as possible. When people feel fearful, their bodies go into
overdrive to ensure that escape is fast and successful. Heart rate and blood pressure
increase to transfer blood to the large muscles. Breathing quickens to improve the flow
of oxygen throughout the body. People sweat to cool off the body and perform more
efficiently. In fact, all of these symptoms of arousal and fear are designed to make escape
easier, allowing for survival in the face of danger.
_Panic attack_ is the clinical term used to describe the experience of intense fear that
takes place even though no realistic danger is actually present. Panic attacks can be trig-
gered by specific situations that people fear (for example, giving an oral presentation,
being in a high place, seeing a snake) or they sometimes occur out of the blue, without
any obvious trigger. Panic attacks are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
To summarize, fear is an emotional reaction to an immediate danger, whereas anxiety
is a state of apprehension about some future threat. For example, worrying about giving
a presentation that is a week away is a reflection of anxiety, whereas experiencing an
adrenaline rush while in the midst of giving a presentation is usually an example of
fear.
Here are a few points to remember:

1. Anxiety and fear are normal emotions everyone experiences from time to
    time.
2. Anxiety and fear are time-limited. Even though they feel as though they
    may continue forever, they always decrease over time.
3. Anxiety and fear have a helpful function in that they prepare you for future
    threats and protect you from danger. So, your goal should not be to rid
    yourself of _all_ fear and anxiety. Rather, your goal should be to reduce your
    anxiety to a level that no longer interferes significantly with your life.

WHAT IS A SOCIAL SITUATION?

A social situation is any situation in which you and other people are present. Social situ-
ations can include those that involve interacting with others (these are often referred to


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

as _interpersonal situations_ ) or situations in which you are the focus of attention or might be
noticed by others (these are often called _performance situations_ ). Examples of interpersonal
situations and performance situations that may be feared by people with high levels of
social anxiety include:

WHAT IS SOCIAL ANXIETY?

_Social anxiety_ refers to nervousness or discomfort in social situations, usually because of
fear about doing something embarrassing or foolish, making a bad impression, or being
judged critically by others. For many people, social anxiety is limited to certain types
of social situations. For example, some people are very uncomfortable in formal work-
related situations, like presentations and meetings, but are quite comfortable in more
casual situations, like parties and socializing with friends. Others may show the exact
opposite pattern, with formal work situations being easier than unstructured social gath-
erings. In fact, it’s not unusual to hear of a celebrity who is quite comfortable performing
in front of large audiences but who otherwise feels shy and nervous when interacting
with people one-on-one or in small groups.
The intensity of social anxiety and the range of feared social situations vary from
person to person. For example, some people experience fear that is fairly manageable,
whereas others are completely overwhelmed by the intensity of their fear. For some people,
the fear is limited to a single social situation (for example, using public restrooms, public
speaking), whereas for others, the social anxiety occurs in almost all social situations.
The experience of social anxiety is related to a number of common personality
styles and traits including _shyness_ , _introversion_ , and _perfectionism_. People who are shy often
feel uncomfortable in certain social situations, particularly when they involve interact-
ing with others or meeting new people. People who are introverted tend to be quieter
and more withdrawn in social situations and may prefer being alone, compared with
people who are extroverted or outgoing. However, introverted people are not neces-
sarily anxious or fearful when socializing. Finally, the trait of perfectionism is associated
with a tendency to hold overly high standards for oneself that are difficult or impossible
to meet. Perfectionism can lead people to feel anxious in public for fear that other people


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

will notice their “flaws” and judge them negatively. Perfectionism is discussed again later
in this chapter.

HOW COMMON IS SOCIAL ANXIETY?

It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of the prevalence of social anxiety because
different studies have tended to define social anxiety differently and used different ques-
tions when interviewing people about their anxiety. Nevertheless, researchers have con-
sistently found that shyness and social anxiety are common experiences. For example, in
a survey of more than 1,000 people from across the United States and elsewhere, psy-
chologist Phillip Zimbardo and his colleagues (Carducci and Zimbardo 1995; Henderson
and Zimbardo 1999; Zimbardo, Pilkonis, and Norwood 1975) found that 40 percent of
those who were asked currently considered themselves to be chronically shy, to the point
of it being a problem. Another 40 percent reported that they had previously considered
themselves to be shy. Fifteen percent more considered themselves to be shy in some
situations and only 5 percent reported that they were never shy. More recent surveys
suggest that the prevalence of shyness may be even higher (for a review of studies on
the prevalence of shyness, see Henderson and Zimbardo 1999).
Researchers have also studied the prevalence of social anxiety disorder (a condition
associated with extreme social anxiety that will be described later in this chapter). In
a recently published survey of more than 9,000 Americans (Kessler et al. 2005), about
12 percent of people reported having the necessary symptoms to receive a diagnosis of
social anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. In fact, social anxiety disorder was
found to be the fourth most prevalent psychological problem in this study, after depres-
sion, alcohol abuse, and specific phobias (for example, phobias of animals, blood, needles,
heights, flying, and so on). Other researchers have found the prevalence of social anxiety
disorder to be lower than 12 percent, but almost all studies have confirmed that social
anxiety disorder is a common problem (Kessler et al., in press).

Differences Between Men and Women

Shyness and social anxiety are common across both sexes, although most studies
have found that social anxiety disorder is slightly more prevalent in women than in men
(Somers et al. 2006). There are a number of possible explanations for why women are
more likely than men to report fearing social situations. First, it’s possible that men are
actually more anxious in social situations than they are willing to admit. For example,
there is evidence from studies of other phobias that men underestimate their levels of
fear (Pierce and Kirkpatrick 1992). Also, in Western societies, women are often expected
to be more socially active than men. Therefore, men may be able to avoid certain types
of social situations more easily than women, without being harassed about their absence
and without experiencing as much social pressure from others in their day-to-day lives.


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
There also may be differences in the types of social situations that men and women
fear. One study found that men with social anxiety disorder were more fearful than
women of urinating in public bathrooms and returning items to stores, whereas women
with social anxiety disorder were more fearful than men of situations such as talking to
people in authority, public speaking, being the center of attention, expressing disagree-
ment, and throwing a party (Turk et al. 1998).

Cultural Differences

It is challenging to measure social anxiety across cultures because signs of social
anxiety in one culture may have a very different meaning in another culture. For example,
whereas some cultures may view poor eye contact as a sign of shyness or social anxiety,
other cultures often avert their eyes from contact with another as an appropriate sign
of respect. Cultures also differ with respect to their use of pauses and silence during
conversation, the preferred physical distance from others, and the appropriate tone of
voice (Sue 1990).
Despite the difficulties in measuring social anxiety across cultures, studies gener-
ally suggest that social anxiety and shyness are common across different ethnic groups.
However, it should be noted that in the United States and Canada, the majority of
people who seek treatment for social anxiety disorder tend to be white and have a
European background. Although people from nonwhite, non-European backgrounds are
just as likely to experience problems with social anxiety, they are less likely to seek help
from a mental health professional.

HOW DOES SOCIAL ANXIETY AFFECT

PEOPLE’S LIVES?

In this section, we will discuss how a person’s social anxiety can affect relationships,
work and school, and other day-to-day activities. After reading each section, take a few
moments to consider how your social anxiety affects each of these areas of your life, and
then describe this in the space provided.

Relationships

Social anxiety can make it difficult for people to establish and maintain healthy rela-
tionships. It can affect all levels of relationships, from those with strangers and casual
acquaintances to those with family and significant others. For many people, even the
most basic forms of social interaction (such as making small talk, asking other people
for directions, saying hello to a neighbor) are very difficult. For such a person, dating


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

may be completely out of the question. Social anxiety may be more manageable around
more familiar people, such as close friends and family—but not always. For some people,
anxiety may actually increase as a relationship becomes more intimate. Also, social anxiety
can interfere with existing relationships, particularly if a socially anxious person’s partner
wants to socialize with others on a more regular basis. The following case examples illus-
trate how social anxiety can have a negative impact on a person’s relationships.

```
UÊ William has never been in a romantic relationship. Although others have
expressed interest in dating him, he always makes excuses not to go out and
usually doesn’t return their phone calls. William desperately wants to be in a
relationship, but he just can’t find the courage to take the initial steps.
```
```
UÊ Cindy is generally comfortable with her male colleagues at work, and she
has several male friends with whom she socializes occasionally. However, as
her relationships with men become closer, she is increasingly fearful that the
other person will discover the “real” Cindy and reject her. She has ended
several relationships with men just as they were becoming close.
```
```
UÊ Jerry frequently argues with his girlfriend about his unwillingness to spend
time with her friends. Although he was quite shy and anxious when they
first started dating, recently his social anxiety has put more of a strain on
their relationship. Because of his anxiety, they have been spending a lot of
time alone while she has wanted to socialize as a couple with other people.
```
```
UÊ Norm has gradually lost many of his friends over the years. For a while after
finishing high school, he kept in touch with his closest friends. However,
because of his anxiety, he often dreaded returning their calls and almost
never accepted their invitations to get together. Eventually, his friends
stopped calling him.
```
```
UÊ Alison’s roommate consistently plays loud music after midnight, making it
impossible for her to sleep. Despite feeling very frustrated and angry, Alison
avoids asking her roommate to turn down her music for fear that her words
won’t come out right or that her roommate will think she is an idiot.
```
```
UÊ When talking to people whom she doesn’t know well, Julia tends to speak very
quietly, keep her distance, and avoid eye contact. As a result, people at work
have started to leave her alone and they rarely invite her to lunch anymore.
```
In the space below, record the ways in which social anxiety has affected your friendships
and relationships.


```

```
Education and Career

Significant social anxiety can have an impact on a person’s education and career.
It can affect the types of courses you take in school and the types of jobs you might
accept. It can also affect job performance as well as your enjoyment of school or work.
Consider the following case examples:

```
UÊ Naveen turned down a promotion at work that involved significant super-
visory responsibilities, including chairing a weekly staff meeting and train-
ing groups of staff. Although the promotion would have provided him with
a significant increase in salary, Naveen was terrified of speaking in front
of groups, and he couldn’t even imagine being able to lead the weekly
meetings.
```
```
UÊ Ruth dropped out of college partway through her third year. As a fresh-
man and sophomore, Ruth had been able to be anonymous in her large
classes. However, when her classes became smaller in her junior year, she
felt increased pressure to participate in class. She began avoiding her lec-
tures and eventually left school.
```
```
UÊ Len dreads going into work each day. He is terrified to speak to his cowork-
ers and avoids speaking to his boss at all costs. Although he never misses
work, Len keeps the time he must talk to others at a minimum. He rarely
takes a break for fear that others will ask him to have lunch or to spend their
breaks with him.
```
```
UÊ Cheryl has been out of work for two years. Although she often hears of jobs
that might be interesting, the thought of having to go through a formal inter-
view is completely overwhelming. On several occasions she has arranged for
job interviews and then failed to show up because of her social anxiety.
```
```
UÊ People at work think that Jason is a snob. He tends to be very serious, and
he speaks very little to others. Even when someone asks him a question, he
tends to answer with only one or two words. In reality, he isn’t a snob; he is
just very shy and anxious around people at work.

Other Day-to-Day Activities

Just about any activity that involves contact with other people can be affected by
social anxiety. The following examples illustrate the range of situations and activities that
are often difficult for people who are socially anxious.

```
UÊ Sita avoids going shopping on Saturdays because the stores are so crowded
and she is fearful of having other people watch her. In fact, just walking
down a busy street is sometimes difficult for her.
```
```
UÊ Michael screens all of his phone calls. He is very anxious when speaking to
people on the phone because he finds it is more difficult to know how they
are reacting to what he says as compared to speaking in person.
```
```
UÊ Kalinda has stopped going to the gym. She was finding that exercising in
front of other people was causing her too much anxiety. Instead she exer-
cises at home, where no one can see her.
```
```
UÊ Reid noticed a small hole in a sweater that he had just purchased. Although
he had not worn the sweater and it still had all the original tags, he was
unable to return the sweater for fear of looking foolish in front of the
salesperson.
```
In the space below, record the ways in which social anxiety has affected your day-to-day
functioning.

SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER (SOCIAL PHOBIA)

When social anxiety becomes particularly severe, it may develop into a condition known
as social anxiety disorder. _Social anxiety disorder_ (also called _social phobia_ ) is one of several
anxiety disorders listed in the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,
Text Revision_ (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association 2000). The DSM-IV-TR is
the guide used by mental health practitioners to identify and diagnose various types of
psychological problems. DSM-IV-TR diagnoses don’t tell us much about the _causes_ of
the disorder. Instead, the disorders listed in the DSM-IV-TR are simply descriptions of
behaviors and experiences that cause interference or distress in a person’s life. In short,
they are a way of classifying emotional and psychological problems.


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
Although there is strong evidence that some of the DSM-IV-TR disorders (for
example, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease) are associated with a biological dysfunc-
tion, the evidence is much less clear for other disorders. The problems listed in the
DSM-IV-TR range from severe mental illnesses to disorders that most people would
consider “bad habits.” In fact, the DSM-IV-TR even includes such problems as nicotine
dependence and impaired sleep resulting from jet lag or shift work.
If your anxiety symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder,
that does not mean that you are sick, have a disease, or are mentally ill. What it does
mean is that you are experiencing social anxiety at a level that bothers you or interferes
with aspects of your functioning. Remember that almost everyone experiences social
anxiety, shyness, or performance anxiety from time to time. The social anxiety experi-
enced by people with social anxiety disorder is associated with the same types of anxious
thoughts and behaviors that most people experience. The difference is that people with
social anxiety disorder experience social anxiety at a more intense level, more frequently,
and often in a wider range of situations than people without social anxiety disorder.
Fortunately, social anxiety disorder responds extremely well to the types of treatment
discussed throughout this book.

Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder

A diagnosis of social anxiety disorder requires that a person have an intense and
persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations. Typically, the fear is
related to anxiety over being scrutinized by others or doing something embarrassing or
humiliating. In addition, the fear must bother the individual or cause significant interfer-
ence in his or her life. In other words, a person would not receive a diagnosis of social
anxiety disorder if he or she had a strong fear of public speaking but didn’t need to speak
in front of groups and didn’t care about having the fear. On the other hand, a person
who fears public speaking and needs to speak in front of groups (for example, a school-
teacher) might be considered to have social anxiety disorder if the criteria are all met.
Social anxiety is often a feature of other problems. For example, people with eating
disorders may be nervous about having other people notice their unusual eating habits.
People who wash their hands excessively due to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
may avoid people either for fear of being contaminated by others or for fear of having
other people notice their OCD symptoms (such as frequent washing, red hands from
washing, and so on). In these examples, the social anxiety would be viewed as part of
the other problem, rather than as social anxiety disorder per se. For social anxiety dis-
order to be diagnosed as a separate problem, there must also be extreme social anxiety
that is unrelated to any other problems that are present. For example, the person might
have a general fear of looking stupid, appearing boring to others, or making mistakes in
front of other people—over and above the anxiety about having others notice his or her
compulsive washing or unusual eating habits.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Diagnosing social anxiety disorder is a complicated task. The information outlined
in this section gives you an idea of how mental health professionals distinguish different
types of problems from social anxiety disorder. However, this overview will probably not
be enough for the purpose of self-diagnosis. If you want to be sure about whether your
symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder, we recommend that
you see a psychiatrist or psychologist who has experience and expertise in the assess-
ment of anxiety disorders.
Unfortunately, even professionals sometimes have difficulty agreeing about whether
the diagnostic criteria for a particular disorder are met. For many people, the criteria
outlined in the DSM-IV-TR don’t fit as neatly as we might like, which makes diagnosis
especially challenging. Fortunately, the exact diagnosis isn’t always necessary for select-
ing an effective treatment. The strategies described in this book will be useful for over-
coming shyness and performance anxiety regardless of whether the full criteria for social
anxiety disorder are met.
One final note about the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder: if all of the criteria for
social anxiety disorder are met and the person is fearful of _almost all_ social situations, the
person is said to have generalized social anxiety disorder.

THREE COMPONENTS OF SOCIAL ANXIETY

In an effort to define shyness, Cheek and Watson (1989) surveyed 180 shy individu-
als about the types of experiences that are associated with shyness and social anxiety.
Eighty-four percent of the participants’ responses to the survey fell into one of three
categories: the physical aspects of social anxiety (uncomfortable feelings and sensations),
the cognitive aspects of social anxiety (anxious thoughts, expectations, predictions), and
the behavioral aspects of social anxiety (for example, avoidance of social situations).
Cognitive behavioral treatments for social anxiety encourage people to think of
their social anxiety in terms of these three components. In other words, when you feel
anxious, you should pay attention to what you feel, think, and do. Breaking down your
social anxiety into these components will help to make the problem feel less overwhelm-
ing and will set the stage for using the strategies outlined in this book.

Social Anxiety and Physical Feelings

Anxiety in social situations is often associated with a long list of physical arousal
symptoms, and some of these feelings may themselves be sources of fear and anxiety.
For example, people with elevated social anxiety are often especially fearful of symp-
toms that may be noticeable to other people, such as shaky hands, sweating, blushing,
and a trembling voice. Examples of feelings that you may experience in social situations
include:


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
```
UÊ Racing or pounding heart
```
```
UÊ Breathlessness or smothering feelings
```
```
UÊ Dizziness or lightheadedness
```
```
UÊ Difficulty swallowing, choking feelings, or a “lump” in the throat
```
```
UÊ Quivering or shakiness (for example, in the hands, knees, lips, or whole
body)
```
```
UÊ Blushing
```
```
UÊ Nausea, diarrhea, or “butterflies” in the stomach
```
```
UÊ Excessive sweating
```
```
UÊ Shaky voice
```
```
UÊ Tearfulness, crying
```
```
UÊ Poor concentration or forgetting what you were trying to say
```
```
UÊ Blurred vision
```
```
UÊ Numbness and tingling sensations
```
```
UÊ Feelings of unreality or being detached
```
```
UÊ Tightness or weakness in the muscles (for example, wobbly legs, sore neck)
```
```
UÊ Chest pain or tightness in chest muscles
```
```
UÊ Dry mouth
```
```
UÊ Hot flushes or chills
```
People who are socially anxious differ from one another with respect to the ways in
which they experience these feelings when they are anxious. Some people report many
different physical symptoms. Others report only a few of these feelings. In fact, some
people are not aware of any physical sensations when they are anxious.
There is also evidence that people are often unable to accurately report the inten-
sity of these sensations. People who are socially anxious often report that their physi-
cal symptoms are very intense, particularly those symptoms that might be visible to
other people. This is, however, often not the case. For the majority of people who are
socially anxious, their symptoms are much less noticeable than they think. For example,
a study by Mulkens, de Jong, Dobbelaar, and Bögels (1999) found that when socially
anxious individuals are exposed to a stressful social situation, they are more likely than
nonanxious individuals to believe that they are blushing. However, the study also found


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

that there were no differences between socially anxious and nonanxious people with
respect to the actual intensity of blushing.
Although in most cases people’s anxiety symptoms are less noticeable than they
think, there is no question that a small number of individuals have a tendency to blush,
shake, or sweat that is clearly excessive and may actually be quite noticeable to other
people. In other words, some people blush easily and others don’t. Some people have
shakier hands than others, and some people perspire more than others. However, not
everyone who blushes, sweats, and shakes excessively also experiences intense fear when
around other people. In fact, many people are not terribly concerned about experiencing
these symptoms in front of other people.
In other words, experiencing these symptoms is not the problem. Rather, it is your
beliefs about the meaning and possible consequences of these symptoms that contributes
to your social anxiety. If you didn’t care whether other people noticed your physical
anxiety symptoms you would probably be much less anxious in social and performance
situations. Furthermore, you would probably experience fewer of these uncomfortable
symptoms.
Not surprisingly, the physical sensations that you experience when you are anxious
or fearful are similar to those that you experience during any intense emotion, including
excitement and anger. The differences between fear, excitement, and anger manifest not
so much in the way they feel physically, but rather in the types of thoughts and behav-
iors associated with each of these emotions. It is to these aspects of social anxiety that
we now turn our attention.

Social Anxiety and Thinking

Strictly speaking, people don’t react emotionally to the situations and events in their
lives. Rather, they react to their beliefs and interpretations concerning these events and
situations. In other words, given an identical situation, different people might have com-
pletely different emotional responses, depending on their beliefs about the situation.
Consider the following example. Imagine that you have interviewed for a job and are
waiting to hear about the outcome of the interview. You were told that you would hear
within a week. Two weeks have passed, and you still haven’t heard from anyone about
whether you were selected for the position. How would you feel? What emotions would
you be experiencing? Well, you might be nervous if you thought the lack of a call was a
sign that you didn’t get the job. On the other hand, if you thought no call was a sign that
decisions had not yet been made, you might feel more optimistic. You might be angry if
you believed that the interviewer was treating you disrespectfully by not calling.
Often our beliefs are accurate; however, sometimes our beliefs are exaggerated or
incorrect. For example, some people who are socially anxious are quick to assume that
another person doesn’t like them just because he or she seems uninterested during a
conversation. In reality, there are many reasons why a person might look uninterested
when talking to you. Some of these include:


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
```
UÊ The other person is not interested in the topic of the conversation but still
likes you as an individual.
```
```
UÊ The other person is hungry.
```
```
UÊ The other person is in a hurry (for example, he or she is late for an
appointment).
```
```
UÊ The other person is tired.
```
```
UÊ The other person is feeling sick or unwell.
```
```
UÊ The other person is shy or socially anxious.
```
```
UÊ The other person is thinking about something stressful that happened earlier
in the day.
```
```
UÊ The other person is worrying about something that is coming up.
```
```
UÊ The other person is someone who generally doesn’t enjoy conversations.
```
```
UÊ The other person is someone who always looks somewhat uninterested,
even when he or she is having a good time.
```
```
UÊ You are incorrectly assuming that the other person is uninterested even
though he or she is showing all the usual signs of interest.
```
If you are anxious in social situations, the chances are that you are either interpret-
ing the situations as threatening in some way or are predicting that something negative
is likely to occur. The more often you experience social or performance anxiety, the
more often you probably engage in this style of anxious thinking. We will provide a more
detailed discussion of the role of thoughts in social anxiety in chapter 6. For now, here
are common beliefs held by people who are socially anxious:

```
UÊ It’s essential that everyone likes me.
```
```
UÊ If someone doesn’t like me, it means I am unlikable.
```
```
UÊ If someone rejects me, I deserve it.
```
```
UÊ People should always be interested in what I am saying.
```
```
UÊ People should never have a disapproving or bored look on their face when
I am talking.
```
```
UÊ People should never talk about me behind my back.
```
```
UÊ If I make a mistake at work, I’ll get fired.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ People will be angry with me if I make a mistake.
```
```
UÊ I’ll make a fool of myself if I give a presentation.
```
```
UÊ People can tell when I’m nervous.
```
```
UÊ People find me unattractive, boring, stupid, lazy, incompetent, weird, weak,
and so on.
```
```
UÊ People are untrustworthy, judgmental, and nasty.
```
```
UÊ I should be able to hide my anxiety symptoms.
```
```
UÊ It’s awful to blush, shake, or sweat in front of others.
```
```
UÊ If my hands shake at work, it will be a disaster.
```
```
UÊ Anxiety is a sign of weakness.
```
```
UÊ I should not appear anxious in front of others.
```
```
UÊ I won’t be able to speak if I’m too anxious.
```
Social Anxiety and Behavior

The most common behavioral response to feeling anxious or frightened is to either
avoid the anxiety-provoking situation completely or to do something else to reduce the
anxiety as quickly as possible. The reason people engage in these behaviors is because
they are very effective at reducing discomfort— _in the short term_. However, in the long
term, these behaviors have the effect of maintaining fear and anxiety in social situations
because they prevent people from learning that their anxiety-provoking predictions are
unlikely to come true. Following are some examples of behaviors that people often use to
reduce their anxiety in social situations. Notice that some of these are examples involv-
ing complete escape or avoidance. However, other examples involve partial avoidance,
efforts to reduce anxiety, or attempts to protect oneself in the situation. These behaviors
are often called _safety behaviors_ , because they are carried out in an effort to feel safer in
the feared situation:

```
UÊ Turning down an invitation to a party
```
```
UÊ Making an excuse not to have dinner with a friend
```
```
UÊ Never answering questions in class
```
```
UÊ Always arriving late for meetings and leaving early in order to avoid making
small talk
```

```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
```
UÊ Offering to help with the dishes at a party in order to avoid talking to the
guests
```
```
UÊ Making an excuse to get off the telephone with a friend or coworker
```
```
UÊ Distracting yourself from your anxious thoughts
```
```
UÊ Having the room dark during your presentation in order to keep the audi-
ence focused on the slides rather than on you
```
```
UÊ Filling out a check before arriving at a store in order to avoid having to write
in front of others
```
```
UÊ Avoiding eye contact and talking very quietly during conversations with
others
```
```
UÊ Wearing makeup and a turtleneck sweater to hide your blushing
```
```
UÊ Always attending the office holiday party with a close friend, spouse, or
other safe person, even though other guests usually attend alone
```
```
UÊ Always arriving for meetings early to ensure that it will not be necessary to
enter the room after everyone else is already seated
```
```
UÊ Having a couple of glasses of wine before meeting another person for a
date
```
Interactions Among the Three Components

The cycle of fear and anxiety can begin with any of the three components we’ve
just discussed. For example, you may be talking to a colleague at work when you notice
yourself perspiring slightly (physical component). That may lead to anxious thoughts
about whether your colleague is noticing your sweaty brow and wondering if there is
something wrong with you (cognitive component). As your anxiety increases, the inten-
sity of your physical sensations increases and you continue to think anxious thoughts.
Eventually, you may make an excuse to leave the situation (behavioral component).
Alternatively, the cycle may begin with the cognitive component. For example,
before giving a presentation, you may tell yourself that you are going to lose your train
of thought and that others will notice how uncomfortable you are. You imagine that the
others will interpret your discomfort as a sign of weakness (cognitive component). As
you continue to dwell on these anxious thoughts, you notice your face beginning to feel
flushed and your heart rate increasing (physical component). Finally, you make a decision
to read your presentation word for word to be sure that your anxiety doesn’t cause you
to lose your place during the presentation (behavioral component).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Finally, the cycle may start with the behavioral component, namely avoidance and
safety behaviors. By putting off getting together with friends for a long time (behavioral
component), you are more likely to experience anxious thoughts (cognitive component)
about what might happen when you do see them, as well as uncomfortable physical
feelings when you are actually in the situation (physical component). Although avoiding
anxiety-provoking situations can be comforting in the short term, it also can have the
effect of making the situation even more uncomfortable when you finally confront it.
The longer you put off an unpleasant task, the harder it is to start the task when you
finally decide to do it.

**Exercise: Components of Social Anxiety**

Over the next week or so, photocopy and use the Three Components of Social Anxiety
Monitoring Form (found at the end of this chapter) to record your anxiety in terms
of the three components of fear. Try to complete the form each time you encounter
a feared social situation (if possible, at least three times in the next week). In the first
column, record the situation (including time and place). In the second column, record
the intensity of your fear using a scale from 0 (no fear) to 100 (maximum fear). In the
third column, record the physical sensations that you experienced in the situation. In the
fourth column, record any anxiety-provoking thoughts or predictions that you are aware
of regarding the situation. Finally, in the fifth column, record any avoidance behaviors or
any other anxious behaviors used to reduce your anxiety. In addition to the blank form,
a sample completed form is included.

OTHER PROBLEMS AND FEATURES

Social anxiety is often associated with other problems. These may include panic attacks
in social situations, excessively high standards and perfectionism, depressed mood, a
negative body image, substance abuse, or difficulty trusting others. We will now discuss
each of these associated difficulties.

Panic Attacks

If you experience intense social anxiety, the chances are good that you have had
panic attacks in social and performance situations. As discussed at the beginning of
this chapter, a panic attack is a rush of fear that occurs in the absence of any realistic
danger. According to the definition of a panic attack, the fear must peak within ten


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
minutes, although it usually peaks immediately or within a few seconds. Also, to meet
the full criteria for a panic attack, there must be at least four symptoms from a list
of thirteen, including racing heart, chest discomfort, dizziness, breathlessness, shaking,
stomach discomfort, sweating, choking feelings, hot flashes or chills, feelings of unreality
or detachment, numbness or tingling, and fears of dying, going crazy, or losing control.
For those who suffer from social anxiety, panic attacks tend to be triggered by
exposure to feared social situations or even just thinking about being in a feared situa-
tion. In addition, people who are socially anxious are often fearful of experiencing panic
symptoms. Because panic-attack symptoms are often incorrectly viewed as a sign that
one is about to lose control, it’s no wonder that people who are socially anxious would
want to avoid having panic attacks in front of others. Even though people who experi-
ence panic attacks often are afraid of losing control, going crazy, fainting, having a heart
attack, or experiencing some other physical or social catastrophe, such consequences
are extremely unlikely. In other words, panic attacks are uncomfortable, but they aren’t
dangerous. In fact, the symptoms often are not even noticeable to other people.

Perfectionism

Research from our organization (Antony et al. 1998) and elsewhere has found that
social anxiety is associated with elevated levels of perfectionism. Perfectionists hold
standards that are unrealistically high and overly rigid. They may have exaggerated con-
cerns about making mistakes and often go out of their way to ensure that mistakes are
avoided.
In social anxiety, people tend to place too much importance on making a perfect
impression on others. If they are not guaranteed to be approved of by others, they may
feel very anxious in social situations or avoid socializing altogether. Perfectionism is
different from simply having high standards. High standards are often useful because
they motivate us to work hard and succeed. In the case of perfectionism, however, the
standards are so high and so inflexible that they actually interfere with performance by
causing a person to overprepare for tasks (for instance, spending hours rehearsing a pre-
sentation), procrastinate (such as putting off preparing for a presentation), or be overly
critical of his or her own performance.

Depression

Given the impact of social anxiety on a person’s functioning, it is no wonder that
a substantial number of people with social anxiety disorder also experience depression.
Severe social anxiety can lead to isolation, loneliness, and deep sadness. Social anxiety
disorder can prevent a person from living up to his or her potential, which, in turn, can
lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression. Depression can also increase the severity
of social anxiety.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

People who are depressed are often embarrassed about feeling down, may assume
that others don’t want to be around them, and may avoid being around other people.
Social anxiety and depression are associated with similar thought patterns as well—
specifically, negative thoughts about oneself and about one’s relationships. Finally, there
is reason to think that social anxiety disorder and depression may be related to similar
biological processes in the brain. In fact, the treatments discussed in this book (including
both psychological treatments and medications) have been shown to be useful for both
anxiety and depression.

Body Image Problems

People who are unhappy with their physical appearance may feel anxious when
socializing or being watched by others. For example, people with eating disorders such
as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa may avoid activities that involve eating in front
of others or showing their bodies (such as wearing shorts, swimming, or exercising in
public). People who are overweight may also be concerned about having their physical
appearance judged negatively by others. In fact, dissatisfaction with any aspect of one’s
physical appearance (for example, losing your hair, not liking your nose, and so on) can
lead some people to experience social anxiety.

Substance Abuse

Some people who experience excessive levels of social anxiety use alcohol or other
drugs to help cope with social situations. In most cases, this may involve only having an
extra glass of wine at a party or having a beer when eating out with friends. However,
for some people, using alcohol or drugs to manage anxiety can become a problem if
the drug or alcohol use becomes excessive. If you frequently use excessive amounts of
alcohol or other drugs to feel more comfortable in social situations, it may be important
to address this issue at the same time that you are working on your social anxiety.

Anger and Mistrust of Others

In addition to fearing negative judgment from others, some people with high levels
of social anxiety may also have difficulty trusting others. They may avoid confiding
in others, not only for fear of being judged, but also because they’re afraid that other
people will not be able to keep a secret. Social anxiety is also sometimes associated with
elevated levels of anger and irritability. For example, some people with social anxiety
disorder may become very angry or hostile when being looked at by others. They may
also become angry at perceived rejections by other people.


```
Shyness and Social Anxiety
```
OVERCOMING SOCIAL ANXIETY

Two general approaches have been shown to be useful for overcoming social anxiety:
psychological strategies and medications. We’ll discuss each of these briefly.

Psychological Strategies

Although there are many different types of psychotherapy practiced by mental
health professionals, there are only a small number of strategies that have been shown to
be effective for reducing social anxiety in a relatively brief amount of time. The chapters
in this book discuss three general approaches that repeatedly have been shown to be
effective for treating social anxiety disorder:

1. Exposure-based strategies will teach you to approach feared situations grad-
    ually, over and over again, until they no longer provoke fear.
2. Cognitive strategies will be used to help you to identify your anxiety- provoking
    thoughts and to replace them with more realistic ways of thinking.
3. Instruction in basic communication skills will teach you to communicate
    more assertively, meet people more easily, give effective presentations, and
    use nonverbal communication appropriately.

Medications

There are a number of medications that have been shown to be effective for decreas-
ing social anxiety. These include a range of antidepressants as well as certain tranquil-
izers. As long as the person continues to take the medication, these treatments are about
as effective as the psychological strategies discussed in this book. For some people, the
combination of medication and psychological treatment is the most effective approach.
In chapter 5 we will discuss the benefits and costs of using particular medications for
treating your social anxiety.

CHAPTER 2

### Why Do You Have

### These Fears?

BIOLOGICAL FACTORS

As with any emotion or personality trait, our biology affects the tendency to experience
anxiety in social situations (Mathew and Ho 2006). Biological processes such as natural
selection or evolution, genetics, brain activity, and alterations in the levels of certain
neurotransmitters in the brain may all contribute to social anxiety. We’ll discuss each of
these in this section.

```
Natural Selection: The Evolutionary Function of
Social Anxiety
```
Natural selection is the process by which members of a species who are best able
to adapt to their environments are the most likely to reproduce successfully, thereby
causing the species to evolve gradually and to survive over a long period of time. It
makes sense that through natural selection, those among us who are most fit and healthy
might be more likely to survive and to reproduce than those who are less so. However,
several authors have argued that many of the _illnesses_ from which humans suffer may also


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

have developed according to the same laws of natural selection that are thought to have
guided the more “positive” aspects of human evolution (Moalem and Prince 2007; Nesse
and Williams 1994).
For example, in their book, _Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine_ , Drs.
Randolph Nesse and George Williams discuss how a number of uncomfortable condi-
tions such as sneezing from allergies, suffering from colds or fevers, and experiencing
pain from injuries all serve to protect us from potential dangers. The same processes that
lead to allergies, colds, and fever also help the body to rid itself of potentially danger-
ous toxins and parasitic viruses. Likewise, pain following an injury is a warning sign that
prevents us from moving our bodies in ways that could worsen the injury.
Might anxiety also improve our chances of survival? As we mentioned in chapter
1, the fight-or-flight response associated with fear and panic protects us from potential
danger. When we are afraid, our bodies quickly become mobilized either to meet the
danger head on or to escape from the danger as quickly as possible. All of the sensations
that we experience when we are frightened (for instance, increased pulse, faster breath-
ing, sweating, hyperventilation, and so on) are designed to help us meet the physical
demands of confronting the threat (fighting) or escaping to safety (flight).
From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that we humans would develop
a propensity for experiencing social anxiety. We are social beings, and as such, we are
very much dependent on those around us. None of us could survive without the help of
others. As infants and children, we are completely dependent on our parents for food,
shelter, comfort, and education. As we grow up, we continue to depend on other people.
We depend on our employers to provide us with money for food and shelter. We depend
on other people to build our homes, grow our food, heal our injuries, entertain us,
and to help us meet most of our day-to-day needs. Because of our dependence on one
another, we learn at a very young age that it is important to get along well with people.
Essentially, we want other people to like us. After all, consistently making a bad impres-
sion on other people might lead to isolation, unemployment, and many other negative
consequences.
Feeling anxious in social situations serves to remind each of us to pay attention to
the effects our behavior has on those around us. If we didn’t think about the impact of
our behavior on others, we would probably get into trouble more often than not. We
wouldn’t bother dressing nicely or being polite. We might always say exactly what’s on
our mind without considering whether it might be hurtful. Feeling anxious in social
situations protects us from offending other people and from doing things that might
lead others to judge us in negative ways. So, not only is it normal to feel shy or socially
anxious from time to time, it is also helpful.
Of course, social anxiety and shyness are not always helpful. Extreme social anxiety
may lead to impaired concentration, which, in turn, can cause a person to make more
errors at work or school. In addition, socially anxious people often avoid taking social
risks and may therefore find it difficult to make friends or to find work. Whereas mild to
moderate levels of social anxiety are completely normal and potentially helpful, extreme
social anxiety can interfere with a person’s functioning.


```
Why Do You Have These Fears?
```
So, from an evolutionary perspective, people with social anxiety disorder do not
have an _illness,_ per se. Rather, they have _too much of a good thing_. Social anxiety is helpful in
small doses, but when it is too intense, it can make life more difficult.

Genetics and Social Anxiety

Social anxiety disorder appears to run in families. For example, a study by Stein,
Chartier, Hazen, Kozak, et al. (1998) found that having a close relative (for example, a
parent, sibling, or child) with _generalized_ social anxiety disorder (extreme anxiety in most
social situations) made an individual ten times as likely to have social anxiety disorder,
compared with individuals who didn’t have a socially anxious relative. In contrast, more
narrowly focused social fears (for example, a fear of public speaking only) were less likely
to run in families.
Of course, the existence of social anxiety disorder in multiple family members does
not necessarily mean that the social anxiety is transmitted by genes. Environmental
factors (for example, learning from one’s parents and siblings) can also contribute to
the family members sharing certain behaviors and tendencies. To tease out the effects
of genetic influences from the effects of environment and learning, scientists have relied
on three main types of studies:

**1. Twin studies.** Twin studies examine the frequency of a problem across pairs
    of _identical twins_ (twins who are 100 percent genetically identical) vs. pairs of
    _fraternal twins_ (twins who share, on average, 50 percent of their genetic mate-
    rial). Because twin pairs tend to be raised in similar environments regardless
    of whether they are identical twins or fraternal twins, a higher social anxiety
    concordance rate in identical twins than in fraternal twins is thought to be
    evidence that genetics may have played a larger role in the development of
    the social anxiety (the term _concordance rate_ refers to the probability of one
    person having a particular problem if his or her twin also has the problem).
**2. Adoption studies**. In adoption studies, scientists interview both the bio-
    logical parents and the adoptive parents of people who were adopted as
    children and who also have the particular problem being studied. If the
    researcher finds that social anxiety disorder occurs much more frequently in
    the biological parents of the socially anxious adoptees than in the adoptive
    parents, it suggests that genetics may be more important than environment.
    Although adoption studies have been used to study the role of genetics
    in various disorders and illnesses, this approach has not yet been used in
    research on social anxiety disorder.
**3. Molecular genetics studies**. In 2003, scientists completed the Human
    Genome Project, which involved mapping all of the genes in human DNA
    and determining the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
make up human DNA. This work has made it possible for scientists to study
particular genes that may be involved in the development of social anxiety
disorder and many other conditions, using research methods known as
linkage studies and association studies.
```
So, what do we know about the role of genetics in social anxiety disorder? Most of
the studies to date on genetics and social anxiety disorder have been twin studies (for
instance, Kendler, Karkowski, and Prescott 1999; Kendler et al. 2001; Stein, Jang, and
Livesley 2002), and there has also been a small number of molecular genetics studies (for
example, Lochner et al. 2007). Generally, twin studies have found modest to moderate
levels of heritability for social anxiety disorder, suggesting that although genetics plays a
role, other factors such as a person’s environment and experiences are also very impor-
tant. Molecular genetics studies are just beginning in the area of social anxiety, and over
time they should help to uncover which genes are most important in the development
of this problem.
Two personality traits closely related to social anxiety appear to be heritable as well,
with _heritability estimates_ (the extent to which the transmission of a trait across generations is
due to genetics) being close to 50 percent across a wide range of studies (Plomin 1989).
One of these traits, called _neuroticism_ , is a general tendency to feel distressed, anxious,
nervous, and worried. The other trait, called _introversion_ , is a tendency to be inwardly
focused and socially withdrawn. Not surprisingly, shyness and social anxiety tend to be
associated with both of these personality styles (Briggs 1988). Recently, researchers have
started to use molecular genetics studies to identify specific genes that may contribute
to traits such as introversion (Stein, Schork, and Gelernter 2004).
If genetics does play a role in causing social anxiety, does that mean that social
anxiety cannot be changed? Not at all. Our genetic makeup affects just about every
aspect of who we are, including physical fitness, academic ability, depression, weight,
personality, and even our interests and hobbies. Yet we all know that our behavior and
experiences still play an important role in determining our behavior and performance in
these various domains.
For example, regardless of whether you are genetically predisposed to be athletic,
training hard will improve your athletic ability. Furthermore, the environment (for
example, the exercise habits that you learn while growing up) may have a profound effect
on whether you exercise regularly as an adult. Still, there are differences between people
with respect to how hard they must train to become physically fit. For some people, it
comes easier than for others—in part, because of their genetic makeup.
The same reasoning holds true for social anxiety. A genetic predisposition to have
high levels of social anxiety and shyness simply means that you may have to work harder
at overcoming the problem than someone who doesn’t have such a tendency.

Effects of the Brain and Neurotransmitters

Compared with other psychological problems, including other anxiety disorders,
studies examining the biological factors underlying social anxiety often have failed to
obtain significant findings. For example, research examining hormonal factors, sleep pat-
terns, and heart functioning has often failed to find differences between people with
social anxiety disorder and people without significant social anxiety.
However, a number of studies have found increased levels of activity in particular
parts of the brain during periods of social anxiety. For example, scientists have found
that people with social anxiety disorder experience increased activity in a part of the
brain called the _amygdala_ when looking at pictures of harsh faces (Phan et al. 2006; Stein
et al. 2002; Straube et al. 2004). The amygdala is part of the _limbic system_ and is activated
when we experience the emotion of fear. During public speaking, there also appears
to be more activation in the amygdala among people with social anxiety disorder than
among people without this problem (Phan et al. 2006).
As reviewed by Britton and Rauch (in press), other areas of the brain that have been
found to be activated during social anxiety include the _anterior cingulate cortex_ (an area that
is involved in controlling emotions, thought, and heart rate, among other functions), the
_medial prefrontal cortex_ (a section of the brain that is involved in complex cognition, per-
sonality expression, and social behavior), the _insular cortex_ (a section of the limbic system
that is involved in the experience of basic emotions, including fear), and the _hippocampus_
(a part of the limbic system that controls memory and spatial abilities). Furthermore,
treatment of social anxiety with either cognitive behavioral therapy or medication leads
to reductions in activity in the amygdala and hippocampus (Furmark et al. 2002).
Studies examining the role of neurotransmitters (the chemicals responsible for
transmitting information throughout the brain) in social anxiety have yielded mixed
results (McCabe and Antony, in press). Some studies suggest that the neurotransmitter
_dopamine_ may be involved in social anxiety, whereas other studies have failed to replicate
these findings. Studies regarding the role of serotonin (another neurotransmitter) have
also yielded mixed findings. However, medications that work on the serotonin system
have consistently been found to be helpful for decreasing the symptoms of social anxiety
disorder (more on this in chapter 5).

PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS

In addition to biology, people’s experiences and beliefs also contribute to whether they
develop difficulties with social anxiety and shyness. The ways in which learning and
beliefs contribute to social anxiety are discussed in this section.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

How Learning Contributes to Social Anxiety

A large number of studies suggests that learning plays an important role in the
development of fear. We learn to fear objects and situations through three main routes
(Rachman 1976). First, directly experiencing a trauma or some negative consequence in
a particular situation can lead to fear. For example, being bitten by a dog can teach a
person to be afraid of dogs. Second, observing other people who are afraid of a situation
can teach a person to be nervous. So, people may be more nervous behind the wheel
of a car if they grew up with a parent who was an anxious driver. Finally, hearing or
reading about the dangers of a particular situation can help to cause or maintain a per-
son’s fear. For instance, reading about airline crashes can help to strengthen a person’s
fear of flying.

```
LEARNING BY DIRECT EXPERIENCE
```
A history of negative experiences in social situations can increase a person’s shyness
and social anxiety. For example, in a study from our center, people with social anxiety
disorder were more likely to describe a history of severe teasing in childhood than were
people with other anxiety problems (McCabe et al. 2003). In addition to teasing, other
examples of social traumas include:

```
UÊ Being bullied by other children while growing up
```
```
UÊ Having parents, friends, teachers, or employers who are overly critical
```
```
UÊ Doing something embarrassing in a social situation (such as making an
obvious mistake, vomiting, having a panic attack, and so on)
```
In the space below, list examples of negative consequences that you have experi-
enced in social situations that may have contributed to or helped to maintain your social
anxiety.

**Examples of Negative or “Traumatic” Experiences That May Have Contributed to
My Social Anxiety**


```
Why Do You Have These Fears?
```
```
LEARNING BY OBSERVING OTHERS
```
Observation is a powerful way of learning to fear specific objects and situations. This
form of learning (also called _vicarious learning_ ) includes developing a fear by observing role
models who themselves are anxious in social situations. Another form of observational
learning involves witnessing another person experience a trauma in a social situation.
Examples of observational learning experiences that could lead to the development of
social anxiety include:

```
UÊ Growing up with family members who are very shy and who rarely
socialize
```
```
UÊ Watching a classmate be severely criticized by a teacher following a
presentation
```
```
UÊ Seeing coworkers become very anxious while giving presentations
```
```
UÊ Witnessing a friend being teased by other students at school
```
In the space below, list examples of observational learning experiences that may have
contributed to or helped to maintain your social anxiety.

**Examples of Observational Learning Experiences That May Have Contributed to
My Social Anxiety**

```
LEARNING THROUGH INFORMATION AND INDIRECT MEANS
```
People can learn to fear social situations by reading about or being warned about the
dangers of making a bad impression on others. Examples of situations that could lead to
developing social anxiety through the transmission of information include:

```
UÊ Being repeatedly told by parents that it is very important to always make a
good impression
```
```
UÊ Being exposed to messages in magazines and on television that your image
is the most important thing about you, and that you are only as attractive
as other people think you are
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

In the space below, list examples of informational learning experiences that may have
contributed to, or helped to maintain, your social anxiety.

**Examples of Indirect or Informational Learning Experiences That May Have
Contributed to My Social Anxiety**

Why Only Some People Develop Extreme Social Anxiety

Although negative experiences, observational learning, and informational learning
are common routes by which people develop fears, they are not enough to explain why
some people develop social anxiety and others don’t. Almost everyone is exposed to
negative experiences in social situations. At one time or another most of us are teased.
We are all exposed to anxiety-provoking messages at home, as well as through the media.
And yet, not everyone develops a problem with social anxiety. Why is this so?
Most likely, there are other factors that influence whether a particular person devel-
ops problems with social anxiety following a history of negative social experiences. These
can include biological factors, such as a person’s genetic makeup. Previous learning expe-
riences and the ways in which someone deals with his or her negative social experiences
may also influence the development of fear. For example, a person who is ridiculed the
first time he or she gives a presentation may be more likely to develop a fear of public
speaking than someone who is ridiculed on a single occasion after having given many
successful presentations previously. Similarly, someone who is severely teased at school
may be protected from developing problems with social anxiety if he or she receives
support from close friends after the episode.
Finally, avoiding a social situation following a traumatic experience may increase the
chances of developing social anxiety. You have probably heard that the best thing to do
after falling off a horse is to get back on as soon as possible to avoid developing a fear of
horses. The same is true of social anxiety. If you avoid a social situation following a trau-
matic experience, you may increase your chances of developing a fear of that situation.


```
Why Do You Have These Fears?

HOW BELIEFS CONTRIBUTE TO

SOCIAL ANXIETY

As discussed in chapters 1 and 6, people with elevated social anxiety tend to think about
social situations in a more negative way than do those people who are less anxious.
Anxiety-provoking thoughts, interpretations, and predictions can lead someone to feel
fear and anxiety in social situations.
There are numerous studies investigating the role of thinking in social anxiety. There
is also evidence that helping people to change their anxious beliefs is an effective way
of decreasing their social anxiety. Research on thinking and social anxiety is reviewed
elsewhere (Antony and Swinson 2000; Hirsch and Clark 2004). Some of the highlights
of this research include the following findings:

```
UÊ People who experience high social anxiety rate negative social events as
more likely to occur and more costly (in terms of their consequences), in
comparison with people who don’t have significant social anxiety.
```
```
UÊ These people tend to interpret their own performance (such as during a
conversation or a speech) more critically than do people who are lower in
social anxiety.
```
```
UÊ They tend to overestimate the extent to which their physical symptoms
(such as blushing) are visible to others.
```
```
UÊ They are more likely than less anxious people to assume that others will
interpret their physical symptoms (shaking, sweating, and so on) as a sign
of a serious problem with anxiety or some mental illness. In contrast, people
who are not socially anxious are less concerned about others noticing their
physical arousal symptoms. Instead, people without significant social anxiety
assume that others will interpret their physical symptoms as normal (perhaps
a sign of feeling hot, being hungry, and so on).
```
```
UÊ When presented with an ambiguous social situation (for example, a stare
from someone else or a phone call that isn’t returned), people with ele-
vated social anxiety have a heightened tendency to interpret the situation
negatively.
```
```
UÊ Social anxiety is associated with a tendency to rate ambiguous or neutral
faces as having a more negative expression.
```
```
UÊ Compared with people who are less anxious, people with social anxiety dis-
order tend to pay more attention to information that represents social threat
than to nonthreatening information. For example, when asked to look at lists
of words, people who are socially anxious spend more time looking at words
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
that are related to social anxiety (words such as “blush” or “party”) than do
those who are less anxious.
```
```
UÊ Social anxiety is associated with a tendency to have a better memory and
recognition for other people’s faces, particularly if the expression on the
face appears to be negative or critical.
```
Taken together, these studies suggest that social anxiety and social anxiety disorder
are associated with thinking styles that may actually make the problem worse. In chapter
6, we’ll discuss ways to change your anxious thoughts and replace them with less anxious
and more realistic ways of thinking. A number of studies investigating the effects of
cognitive behavioral therapy on the negative thinking styles often associated with social
anxiety have found that treatment leads to a reduction in negative thinking (Hirsch and
Clark 2004).

HOW BEHAVIORS CONTRIBUTE TO

SOCIAL ANXIETY

As discussed in chapter 1, avoidance of social situations can have the effect of increas-
ing social anxiety over the long term. In other words, the strategy that people who
are socially anxious use most frequently to cope with their fear may actually make the
problem _worse_.
In addition, some behaviors that people use to protect themselves in social situa-
tions can actually lead to the very outcome that people with social anxiety disorder fear
most—a negative reaction from others. For example, if when talking to other people at
a party, you speak very quietly, avoid eye contact, and avoid expressing your views and
opinions, people may choose to talk to someone else. They may interpret your behavior
as a sign that you’re not interested in talking or that you are a difficult person to get
to know. See chapters 7 through 9 for a discussion of strategies for confronting feared
situations instead of avoiding them and for stopping the safety behaviors that help to
maintain your fear over time. And, in chapter 10, we’ll discuss strategies for improving
communication and social skills.


CHAPTER 3

### Getting to Know Your

### Social Anxiety

WHY CONDUCT A SELF-ASSESSMENT?

The initial step that a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional
takes in beginning to help an individual with a particular problem is a period of evalua-
tion and assessment. This evaluation process involves collecting information needed to
better understand the nature and extent of the problem so that the best possible treat-
ment plan can be formulated. This initial assessment almost always involves an interview
and may also include various questionnaires and standard tests. Sometimes, the therapist
may ask the person to start keeping a diary to monitor specific thoughts or behaviors.
In the case of social anxiety, a clinician might spend the first session (or even the
first few sessions) asking questions about the client’s social anxiety, about other difficul-
ties he or she might be experiencing, and about the person’s general background and
life experiences. The individual also may be asked to answer a series of questionnaires
that measure social anxiety and related problems. In addition, the client is often asked
to complete diary entries between sessions to measure the person’s anxiety in social
situations, his or her feelings of depression, and any other aspects of the problem. The
assessment process helps the clinician to understand the person’s problems and is useful
for choosing an appropriate course of treatment. In addition, repeating certain assess-
ments from time to time allows the clinician to measure whether treatment is working
(Antony and Rowa 2005).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

In the same way, a detailed self-assessment will help you to understand and address
your difficulties with social anxiety. We strongly recommend that, before you begin
working on changing your own social anxiety, you carry out a careful self-assessment.
This assessment process will have the following four main benefits. It will:

1. Allow you to measure the severity of your social anxiety
2. Help you to identify key problem areas
3. Make it easier to choose the most appropriate treatment strategies
4. Provide you with an opportunity to measure your improvement as you use
    the strategies described in this book

```
Now we will discuss each of these issues in greater detail.
```
MEASURING THE SEVERITY OF YOUR

SOCIAL ANXIETY

The term “severity” takes into account such variables as (1) the intensity of your fear in
social and performance situations, (2) the range of different situations that precipitate
your social anxiety, (3) the frequency with which you experience intense social anxiety,
(4) the effect of your social anxiety on your day-to-day life, career, and relationships,
and (5) the extent to which being socially anxious bothers you. Generally, as the sever-
ity of social anxiety increases, typically, so does the intensity of the fear, the number of
situations that are affected, the frequency with which anxiety is experienced, the level of
interference with day-to-day functioning, and the extent to which a person is bothered
by having the fear.

IDENTIFYING WHICH PROBLEMS TO WORK ON

If you’re like many people, you probably experience anxiety in a number of different
social situations. A comprehensive self-assessment will help you to decide which fears
to work on first. First, it will be important to identify which situations you fear and
avoid. Next, you will need to identify your priorities—that is, which aspects of the
problem you want to begin to address first. When choosing your priorities, here are
some suggestions to keep in mind:

```
UÊ Begin working on problems for which you are likely to see quick changes.
Early improvements will help to motivate you to work on more difficult
situations.
```

```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
```
UÊ Try to work on fears that interfere the most with your day-to-day life. Being
able to confront the most disabling fears will have a much bigger impact on
your life than working on fears that are less important to you.
```
```
UÊ If one of your treatment aims is very important to you but is just too over-
whelming to deal with, divide that goal into smaller, more manageable
objectives. For example, if you are afraid of dating, you could work on your
fear by breaking the situation down into steps such as saying hello to an
attractive classmate, sitting beside the classmate for several weeks in a row,
speaking with the classmate after class, offering to study with the classmate,
and asking the classmate to have dinner with you after class.
```
CHOOSING THE BEST STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE

A self-assessment also can help you to decide which treatment strategies to use. In many
cases, the specific treatment approaches you select will be directly related to factors you
identify in your self-assessment. Consider the following examples of how an assessment
can help you to select the best approaches for treatment:

```
UÊ Identifying which situations you fear and avoid will help you to choose
which situations to select for exposure practices (as described in chapters
7 and 8).
```
```
UÊ Identifying the extent to which you are fearful of the physical feelings that
you experience when you are anxious will help determine whether you
should practice exposure to uncomfortable physical sensations (as described
in chapter 9).
```
```
UÊ Assessing those areas in which your social skills can be improved will help
you to decide whether to spend time working on the skills involved in asser-
tiveness, public speaking, dating, or general communication. (See chapter
10 for strategies for improving various types of social and communication
skills.)
```
```
UÊ If you decide to take medications for your social anxiety, the choice of
which medication to try will depend on your previous response to medica-
tions, possible interactions with other medications you take, medical condi-
tions you may have, side effects that you are willing to tolerate, as well as a
number of other factors. If you are considering using medications, thinking
about these issues should be part of your self-assessment (see chapter 5).
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

MEASURING YOUR IMPROVEMENT

Assessment is not only for the initial phase of your treatment. Rather, the process of
assessment should continue throughout treatment and even after treatment has ended.
Continuing the assessment process throughout treatment will provide you with a way of
measuring how much your social anxiety has improved as a result of using the strategies
described in this book. Also, conducting occasional self-assessments after treatment has
ended will let you know whether your treatment gains have continued over time.

STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE FOR CONDUCTING

A SELF-ASSESSMENT

Therapists and clinicians who treat social anxiety use a number of tools to assess clients
and patients. The most common of these include the following.

Clinical Interviews

Interviews involve asking a person specific questions about his or her background,
anxiety symptoms, and related problems. It is an easy way of getting to know someone
and learning about his or her difficulties simply by talking.

Questionnaires

Questionnaires include paper-and-pencil tests that a person completes before begin-
ning treatment, and perhaps again during treatment and after treatment ends. They are
used to provide additional information not covered in the interview, as well as to confirm
and expand upon the information provided in the interview.

Diaries

Diaries are completed on a day-to-day basis between therapy sessions. They are
useful because they provide the individual with an opportunity to record his or her
thoughts and feelings as they occur, rather than having to remember all of the details of
a complex event later.

Behavioral Assessment

A behavioral assessment involves directly observing a person’s behavior or asking
the person to perform a specific behavior and then measuring the thoughts and feelings
that arise in that situation. The most common types of behavioral assessment for social


```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
anxiety are the _behavioral approach test_ and _behavioral role-play_. These involve having a person
enter a feared social situation (behavioral approach test) or act out a feared situation
in a role-play (behavioral role-play) and having the person report his or her fear level,
anxious thoughts, and other experiences.
Although these assessments are usually conducted by a psychologist, psychia-
trist, or other professional, each can be adapted to be part of your self-assessment. We
recommend that your assessment include the following three steps:

```
UÊ Conduct a self-interview. For example, answer important questions about
your anxiety and related problems.
```
```
UÊ Complete anxiety diaries. An example is the Three Components of Social
Anxiety Monitoring Form included in chapter 1.
```
```
UÊ Complete a behavioral approach test or role-play.
```
Conducting a Self-Interview

Any professional contact with a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health
professional typically begins with a clinical interview, during which the clinician asks the
client or patient questions about his or her problems. The interview helps the clinician to
identify the most important features of the problem and is a first step toward developing
an effective treatment plan. To be consistent with this goal, we suggest that you conduct
a _self-interview_ , in which you answer important questions about your problem.
To help you with this process, we have identified ten basic questions you should try
to answer at the start of your self-assessment. The answers to these questions will help
you to do the following: decide whether social anxiety is in fact a problem for you; iden-
tify the factors that contribute to your social anxiety; and choose the specific situations
that you need to work on most. At the beginning of chapter 4, we will suggest additional
questions that will help you to develop a treatment plan.

```
WHICH SOCIAL SITUATIONS DO YOU FEAR AND AVOID?
```
For each of the following situations (divided into interpersonal situations and per-
formance situations, as defined in chapter 1), record a number ranging from 0 to 100 to
rate (1) the extent to which you fear the situation during a typical or average encounter
and (2) the extent to which you typically avoid the situation. For example, if you have an
intense fear of making presentations but you avoid the situation only about half the time,
your fear rating might be an 80 and your avoidance rating might be a 50. If the situation
is one that you never encounter, base your ratings on how fearful you _imagine_ you would
be in the situation and how much you would avoid the situation if it did come up from
time to time. Use the following scales to rate your fear and avoidance levels.

WHICH VARIABLES MAKE YOUR ANXIETY BETTER OR WORSE?
```
An important step in your self-assessment is to become aware of the variables that
make your fear better or worse in a given situation. For example, if you are fearful
of eating with other people, there are many factors that could influence your fear in
this situation, including who you’re eating with, where you’re eating, and what you’re
eating. Identifying the variables that affect your level of fear in a particular situation
will help you to set up appropriate practices when you begin to use the exposure-based
techniques discussed later in this book.
Following is a list of variables that sometimes affect a person’s fear and anxiety
in social situations. For each item, record a number ranging from 0 to 100 to rate the
extent to which the variable listed affects your level of fear or discomfort in the types of
social situations that you fear. For example, if you are much more anxious when talking
to a woman than when talking to a man, you might rate the effect of the other person’s
sex on your anxiety at about a 75 or 80. Use the following scale to obtain your rating.

Following is a list of physical feelings that people sometimes experience when they
are feeling anxious, worried, or frightened. For each item, you should first record a
number (from 0 to 100) that reflects the intensity of the feeling during a typical expo-
sure to an anxiety-provoking social situation. A rating of 0 means that, typically, you do
not experience the sensation at all, and a rating of 100 means that the sensation typically
is extremely intense when you encounter social situations that are a problem for you.
Next, using a scale from 0 to 100, rate the extent to which you are fearful of experi-
encing the sensation in front of other people. A rating of 0 means that you are not at all
concerned about experiencing the sensation in front of others and a rating of 100 means
that you are extremely fearful of experiencing the sensation in front of others.

WHAT ARE YOUR ANXIETY-PROVOKING BELIEFS, PREDICTIONS,
AND EXPECTATIONS?
```
As discussed in chapter 1, your beliefs have a big impact on how you feel in social
situations. For example, if you expect that others will think you are stupid, weak, or
unattractive, you are very likely to feel anxious around other people. On the other hand,
if you are not especially concerned about what others think about you in a particular
situation, you’re much more likely to feel comfortable. Often, our beliefs and predic-
tions are not based on reality. For people who experience elevated anxiety in social and
performance situations, beliefs and expectations about these situations are often nega-
tive. These thoughts tend to exaggerate the likelihood of danger and lead the person to
expect the worst, even when there is no reason to do so.
Cognitive therapy involves teaching people to identify and change their anxious
beliefs, predictions, and expectations by considering more realistic alternative beliefs.
Before you can change your thoughts, however, you need to be able to observe them
and to decide whether they are unrealistic and whether they are contributing to your
anxiety.
Chapter 1 lists examples of thoughts and expectations that contribute to social
anxiety. Some of these include basic assumptions, such as, “It is important that every-
one likes me” and “Nobody will ever think I am interesting.” Other anxiety-provoking
thoughts may be more focused on a particular situation, such as, “If I arrive at class early,
I won’t be able to think of anything to say” and “People will think I am weird if they
notice my hands shaking.”
To identify your own anxiety-provoking thoughts, we recommend the following
steps. First, review some of the examples of anxiety-provoking thoughts listed in chapter

1. These will give you an idea of the types of thoughts that are often associated with
social anxiety. Next, think of social situations that you find particularly difficult (for
example, talking to strangers, eating with other people, speaking at meetings) and try to
answer the following questions. Your answers to these questions will give you an idea of
the types of thoughts, predictions, and expectations that help to maintain your anxiety.

**Your Anxiety-Provoking Beliefs**

**What am I afraid will happen in the situation?**

**What might people think about me in the situation?**

**Is it almost always important that I make a good impression? Why?**

**How will I react in the situation (what symptoms will I exhibit)?**

**What if my expectations come true? What might that lead to?**

**Am I aware of any other beliefs or predictions that contribute to my anxiety?**


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
WHAT ARE YOUR ANXIOUS BEHAVIORS?
```
Anxiety and fear are usually accompanied by a strong urge to do something to
reduce these uncomfortable feelings. Are there behaviors that you use to reduce your
anxiety? Here are some examples.

**Avoidance of social situations.** Are there situations that you refuse to enter? For example,
do you avoid going to parties, particularly when you won’t know people there? When
the telephone rings, do you avoid answering it? Do you turn down opportunities to do
presentations even when they are important? Avoidance is one of the most common
behaviors that helps to maintain your fear and anxiety. Earlier in this chapter you rated
the extent to which you fear and avoid various social situations. As part of this review
of your anxious behaviors, look over that list again and note which situations you tend
to avoid at least some of the time. If there are any other situations that come to mind,
list them below.

**Overcompensating for perceived deficits.** Are there ways in which you try extra hard
in social situations to compensate for flaws or faults that you perceive yourself to have?
For example, do you overprepare for presentations by putting together too much mate-
rial, memorizing the presentation, or reading the presentation word for word from your
notes? Do you rehearse everything that you are going to say before meeting a friend
for dinner, just in case you become overly anxious and lose your train of thought? Do
you go out of your way to talk a lot to appear outgoing, just so people won’t notice that
you’re anxious? Each of these is an example of how people sometimes overcompensate
to cover up what they perceive to be flaws. If you can think of examples of times when
you have overcompensated in social situations for what you thought were flaws or faults,
list them below.

**Excessive checking and reassurance seeking.** Social anxiety, shyness, and performance
anxiety sometimes can lead people to engage in frequent checking and reassurance
seeking behaviors. Examples include frequently looking in the mirror to make sure that


```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
your hair is perfect and continually asking your friends to reassure you that you are
interesting or smart.
Although it is helpful to seek reassurance from time to time, constant reassurance
seeking can have a negative impact by helping to maintain your fear. By asking for reas-
surance over and over again, you may strengthen the belief that there is something
wrong with you. (Why else would you need to check so often?). Also, you run the risk
of never learning to provide yourself with the reassurance that you may need. Finally,
constantly asking others for reassurance may cause some of your greatest fears to come
true by negatively affecting how others view you. Other people may get tired of always
having to provide you with reassurance. Also, if you constantly ask others to make judg-
ments about you (for instance, to tell you how smart, attractive, or interesting you are),
you may actually be training them to be more observant and scrutinizing of you than
they might otherwise be.
In the space below, list some examples of times when you have engaged in excessive
checking or reassurance seeking.

**Other subtle avoidance and safety behaviors.** Overcompensating for perceived deficits
and excessive checking are both examples of _safety behaviors_ because they are used to
help you feel safer in social situations. Unlike complete avoidance of feared situations,
these are more subtle avoidance behaviors, and they can be more difficult to notice. Are
there other subtle ways in which you avoid situations or safety behaviors that you use to
protect yourself from feeling anxious in social situations?
For example, if you have to give a presentation, do you stand in a particular place?
Do you wear certain clothes to hide “defects” that you perceive in your appearance? Do
you purposely end the presentation late so that there is no time for questions? Do you
use videos or slides during the presentation so the focus won’t be on you? Do you avoid
making eye contact with the audience? If you’re attending a party, do you purposely stay
close to someone you know well so that you won’t have to talk to other people? Do you
have a drink or two as soon as you get to the party so that your anxiety doesn’t get too
high? Do you offer to help in the kitchen so you won’t have to talk to the other guests?
Do you take frequent bathroom breaks to avoid being with everyone else? When you’re
talking to other guests at the party, do you ask the other person lots of questions to keep
the focus of the conversation off of you?
All of these are examples of subtle avoidance strategies that people sometimes use in
social situations. As discussed in chapter 1, these behaviors may decrease your anxiety
in the short term by helping you to feel safer. However, in the long term, they typically
have the effect of preventing your anxiety from decreasing naturally over time because


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

they prevent you from learning that the situation can be safe and manageable even
without relying on subtle avoidance strategies. In the spaces that follow, list examples of
subtle avoidance or safety behaviors that you use to manage your anxiety in social situ-
ations. Because these behaviors may differ from situation to situation, there is space to
record these behaviors for up to five different social situations.

**Social Situation Subtle Avoidance and Safety Behaviors**

**Comparing yourself to the “wrong” people.** One of the ways in which we evaluate our-
selves is to make comparisons with other people. In school, we ask our classmates how
they did on their exams to get an idea of how our own work compares to that of others.
We are curious about our coworkers’ salaries, in part because having that information is
a way of knowing whether we are being paid fairly.
Research has consistently found that most people compare themselves to others
whom they perceive to be either similar to themselves or slightly better in a particular
dimension. For example, an average student is likely to compare his or her grades to
those of other average students or to slightly better-than-average students. Similarly, a
top athlete tends to compare his or her performance to other top athletes in order to
judge the quality of his or her own performance. This pattern of social comparison makes
sense because it is most likely to provide information you can use to gauge your own
performance. Comparing yourself to someone whom you perceive to be much better or
much worse than you in a particular dimension will provide information that isn’t espe-
cially relevant to you. For example, if you are a musician who plays mostly in local clubs,
it doesn’t make sense to compare your success to that of the most popular and successful
musicians in the world. Making such comparisons is likely to cause you to feel inadequate
because you will perceive that you can’t possibly compete with the best.


```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
Research from our center (Antony et al. 2005) suggests that people who are
socially anxious make different types of social comparisons than do those who are less
anxious. Specifically, social anxiety is associated with a tendency to make more frequent
“upward” comparisons. In other words, people who are socially anxious are more likely
to compare themselves to people they perceive as better than they are. The tendency
to make upward comparisons increases the likelihood that an individual will feel worse
after making the comparison.
Can you think of recent examples of when you have compared yourself to someone
whom you perceived to be more attractive, more competent, less anxious, stronger, or
smarter than you are? Or, did you make an upward comparison on some other dimension?
How did you feel afterward? Do you often tend to compare yourself to people whom
you perceive to be ideal or perfect on a certain dimension, rather than people whom you
perceive to be typical or average? In the space below, describe an example of a time when
you compared yourself to someone who was much “better” than you in some way.

```
COULD YOU BENEFIT FROM IMPROVING YOUR “PEOPLE SKILLS”?
```
Everyone has times when they give off the wrong impression simply because they
didn’t know how to communicate a particular message to another person or group.
Generally, this is not a big problem unless it happens frequently or in situations where
there is a lot at stake.
In most cases, people who are socially anxious have fine social skills, though they tend
to assume that their social skills are much worse than they actually are. Furthermore, as
their anxiety decreases and they obtain more practice interacting with others in the situ-
ations that they fear, their skills tend to improve over time. Following are some examples
of areas where you may want to consider working on improving your skills. This may
prove to be particularly helpful for situations that you have tended to avoid over the
years and therefore may not have had the opportunity to learn some of the subtleties
of navigating your way through the situation. For example, if you have never dated, you
may need some practice before knowing how to ask someone out on a date to maximize
your chances of a positive response. As you read through the examples, try to identify
people skills that you may want to work on. There is space at the end of this section to
record your responses.

**Assertiveness.** Do you have difficulty being assertive? In other words, is it hard for you
to say no if someone asks you to do something that you don’t want to do? Is it difficult
to ask people to change their behavior if they are treating you unfairly or aren’t doing


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

their share of the work? Most people sometimes find it difficult to deal directly and
assertively with situations like these. However, the more difficulty that you have in situ-
ations that call for assertive communication, the more you have to gain from learning
assertiveness skills.

**Body language, tone of voice, and eye contact.** Do you have difficulty making eye contact
with other people? Does your tone of voice or body language send the message that you
are not open to interacting with others? Behaviors that convey such messages may include
speaking very quietly or letting your voice drop off at the end of your sentences, standing
far away from other people when you’re talking with them, answering questions with very
short responses, and displaying a “closed” body posture (such as crossing your arms and
legs). Although you may use these behaviors to protect yourself in social situations, they
may actually have the opposite effect by turning others away. If you send the message to
others that you are unavailable, they will be more likely to leave you alone.

**Conversation skills.** Do you have difficulty knowing what to say when talking to people
at work or school? Is it hard to know how or when to end conversations? Do you find
it difficult to know where the fine line is between appropriate self-disclosure and talking
too much about yourself? Do you often offend other people with comments that you
make? If you have difficulty making small talk or engaging in casual conversations, you
may benefit by working on improving these skills.

**Meeting new people.** Do you have difficulty knowing what to say when you want to
initiate contact with new people? Do you have difficulty asking someone out on a date?
Are you at a loss for knowing how and where to meet new people? There are lots of
different places to meet new people and lots of tricks to making meeting people easier.
The first step is identifying whether this is an area that you would like to work on.

**Presentation skills.** Speaking effectively in public involves a number of complex skills
and behaviors. It’s not enough to be calm and confident. An effective speaker also knows
how to maintain the audience’s interest by using humor and effective audiovisual aids
and handouts, stimulating audience participation, and conveying an interest in the topic.
If you fear making presentations, part of overcoming your fear may include improving
your speaking skills.
In the space below, list any social or communication skills that you might like to
improve.

HOW MUCH DOES YOUR SOCIAL ANXIETY BOTHER YOU OR
INTERFERE WITH YOUR LIFE?
```
As we discussed in chapter 1, social anxiety, shyness, and performance-related fears
are only a problem if they interfere with aspects of your functioning or if having the
fear is troublesome for you. So, as part of your self-assessment, it’s important for you to
determine which aspects of your fear trouble you and which don’t. Are there particular
situations for which you are most interested in overcoming your fear? For example, it
may be important for you to overcome your fear of socializing with friends but relatively
less important for you to overcome your fear of speaking in front of large groups if that
situation never arises.
In the space below, record (1) the ways in which your social anxiety interferes with
your functioning (including work or school, social life, relationships, hobbies and leisure
activities, home and family life), (2) the specific aspects of your social anxiety that
you most want to change, and (3) any aspects of your social anxiety that you are not
interested in working on.

HOW AND WHEN DID YOUR SOCIAL ANXIETY BEGIN?
```
How old were you when you first had significant anxiety in social situations? What was
going on at that time in your life?

How old were you when you first noticed that your social anxiety began to interfere with
aspects of your life? What was going on at the time?

What has the course of your social anxiety been over the years? Has it improved, stayed
the same, or worsened? Are you aware of factors that may have caused it to change over
the years (for example, getting married or moving to a new neighborhood)?

Are there specific events that initially caused you to become more nervous in social
situations or made your social anxiety worsen? (Examples may include experiences such
as presentations that didn’t go well, being teased while growing up, or doing something
embarrassing or humiliating in public.)


```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
```
DOES ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY HAVE THIS PROBLEM?
```
Are you aware of anyone else in your family having problems with shyness, social anxiety,
or performance-related fears? If so, do you think that this had an influence on how you
feel in these situations? If yes, how?

```
ARE THERE ANY PHYSICAL CONDITIONS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO
YOUR SOCIAL ANXIETY?
```
For some individuals, certain physical or medical conditions may influence their
tendency to experience social anxiety. For example, people who stutter may be more
nervous when talking to others compared with people who don’t stutter. Often, their
fear is exclusively related to a concern that they will stutter and that others will notice.
Similarly, people suffering from other medical conditions (for example, shaking due
to Parkinson’s disease, having to move about in a wheelchair, not being able to write
neatly due to severe arthritis) may be self-conscious about having others observe their
symptoms.
Other people, although they may not be suffering from a medical condition, may
still have a greater tendency than others to have shaky hands, blush easily, or sweat
excessively, independent of their fears. For these individuals, these reactions tend to be
very intense and may often occur even outside of social situations and when they are not
particularly anxious. Although many people who experience these symptoms at such an
extreme level are not concerned about others noticing, for some, having these extreme
symptoms contributes to their social anxiety.

Do you suffer from any physical conditions or medical illnesses that add to your anxiety
around other people? If so, record the details below.

DIARIES

The diaries used to assess social anxiety are usually forms on which individuals record
their anxiety-related symptoms, including frequency of exposure to feared situations,


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

anxiety levels (using a numeric scale such as 0 through 100), uncomfortable physical
sensations such as blushing or shaking, anxious thoughts and predictions (for instance,
“I will make a fool of myself during this presentation”), and anxious behaviors such as
avoidance and distraction. An example of such a diary is the Three Components of
Social Anxiety Monitoring Form, which you completed in chapter 1. Numerous other
forms and diaries are included throughout this book as well. They are designed to be
used while you try the specific treatment techniques described in later chapters.

BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENTS

The most commonly used type of behavioral assessment for social anxiety is the
Behavioral Approach Test, or BAT. This assessment method involves physically entering
a feared situation and measuring your anxiety and associated symptoms. For example, if
you are afraid of public speaking, you might force yourself to speak at a staff meeting.
After the meeting, you can record the particulars of the situation (who else was there,
how long you spoke for, and so on), your fear level (for example, 80 out of 100), your
anxious thoughts (such as, “My words will come out all jumbled”), and whether you
engaged in any avoidance behaviors (like avoiding eye contact).
If it is too frightening to try this in a real-life situation, or if it is impossible to do
so for another reason, the assessment can be completed in the form of a role-play. In
a role-play, the person acts out the feared situation with the therapist or another indi-
vidual present, instead of being in the real situation. For example, if you are afraid of
job interviews, you might try to practice a job interview with another person (friend,
family member, or therapist) taking the role of the interviewer. Following the practice,
you would again record the particulars of the situation, your fear level, your anxious
thoughts, and your avoidance behaviors.
Therapists use behavioral assessments because they have several advantages over
traditional forms of assessment, such as interviews and questionnaires. First, they are
less likely to be influenced by people’s difficulties in remembering the details of their
fears. For example, some people may overestimate or underestimate their fear levels if
they are asked to describe their fear during past exposures to feared situations. Their
memories may be influenced by a particularly negative experience in a feared situation
and, as a result, they may report that their fear is actually higher than it typically is.
Also, people’s memories regarding their reactions in the situations they fear may be poor
simply because they typically avoid the fearful situation, making it difficult to know for
sure how they feel when they are exposed to the situation.

Another advantage of the behavioral approach test is that it allows the therapist and
the individual to directly observe anxious thoughts and behaviors that might otherwise
go unnoticed. It also allows the therapist to independently assess the extent to which the
client’s shaking, blushing, or sweating is actually noticeable to others.


```
Getting to Know Your Social Anxiety
```
Can you think of a behavioral approach test or role-play that you can set up for
yourself? For example, if you are fearful of speaking up in a meeting, try doing it anyway.
Immediately after the meeting, record your physical symptoms, anxious thoughts, and
the avoidance behaviors that took place while you were conducting the practice. Did it
go better than you expected it to go? Was it worse? Was it about what you expected?

TROUBLESHOOTING

You may find that your self-assessment does not go as smoothly as you might like. Here
are some common problems that may arise during your self-assessment, as well as some
solutions, suggestions, and words of reassurance.

**Problem:** I didn’t know the answers to all the questions.

**Solution:** That’s to be expected. As you progress with the treatment, you will have
an opportunity to become better acquainted with your social anxiety.
Self-assessment is an ongoing process, and it’s not necessary to have all
the answers before you start to work on changing your social anxiety. In
fact, there may be some questions that you will never know the answers
to, and that’s okay. The purpose of this chapter is just to help you better
understand the areas that are causing you the most difficulty.

**Problem:** Answering these questions increased my anxiety.

**Solution:** This is quite common. Conducting a self-assessment forces you to pay
attention to the thoughts that contribute to your anxiety. This effect of
increased anxiety tends to be temporary. As you progress through the
treatment procedures discussed throughout this book, it is likely you
will find that focusing on the thoughts and feelings associated with your
social anxiety will become less anxiety provoking.

**Problem:** My answers to these questions depend on many different variables, so I
find it difficult to come up with a response to certain questions.

**Solution:** This concern is often raised by people who are undergoing an assessment.
Questions are often difficult to answer because the responses depend
on so many different factors. For example, the question, “How fearful
are you of public speaking?” may depend on such things as the topic
of the presentation, the number of people in the audience, the lighting
in the room, the length of the presentation, how prepared you are, and
many other factors. We suggest that you handle difficult questions by
estimating your response based on a typical or average situation. So,
if your fear of public speaking ranges from 30 to 70 depending on the
situation, you could put down 50. If you prefer, you could just record
the range “30 to 70” which would be more precise.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

After reading this chapter, you should have a better understanding of the nature of
your social anxiety. You should be more aware of the types of social situations that you
fear and avoid, the variables that affect your discomfort level, the physical sensations
that you experience when you are anxious, the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to
your fear, and the ways in which social anxiety interferes with your life. Understanding
these aspects of your social anxiety will help you to choose the best strategies for over-
coming your fear as you work your way through the rest of this book.

CHAPTER 4

### Making a Plan for Change

This chapter will help you to consider the range of factors that are important for devel-
oping a treatment plan. These factors include deciding whether this is the best time for
you to work on your social anxiety, addressing the issue of motivation and readiness for
change, selecting treatment goals, trying to understand why treatment may or may not
have worked in the past, and understanding your current options for treatment.

IS NOW THE BEST TIME TO START

THIS PROGRAM?

In some ways, it may seem as if there is never a good time to begin a new project.
There are almost always competing demands that make it difficult to find free time or
extra energy to start something new. Work may be unusually busy, you may be getting
over a cold, or your children may be a handful right now. Although the time may not
be perfect, you will need to decide whether it is even a possibility for you to start this
program given your current life circumstances. Your chances of getting the most out of
this book will depend on your answering yes to the following questions:

```
UÊ Are you motivated to become less shy or to decrease your social anxiety?
Is this something you really care about?
```
```
UÊ Are you willing to feel even more anxious in the short term in order to feel
more comfortable in social and performance situations in the future?
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Are you able to put aside, at least to some extent, other major problems and
stresses in your life (things such as family problems or work stresses) so that
you can focus on learning to manage your social and performance anxiety?
```
```
UÊ Are you able to set aside several blocks of time several days per week to
practice the techniques described in this book?
```
Hopefully, after carefully considering these questions, you will make a commitment
to work on overcoming your social anxiety. However, you may also decide that this
is not the best time for you to work on the problem and that you would rather wait
until your life situation changes. If that is the case, you may still find reading this book
helpful because it contains strategies that can be used from time to time, as you need
them. However, making big changes will require using the techniques described in this
book frequently and consistently. The next section will help you further as you decide
whether to work on your anxiety at this time.

MOTIVATION AND READINESS FOR CHANGE

Experts have identified five stages that people go through as they contemplate making
a change in behavior, such as quitting smoking, losing weight, or improving their work
habits (Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross 1992). The model describing these _stages of
change_ is often referred to as the _transtheoretical model of change._ These five stages include:

**1. Precontemplation**. At this stage, people are unaware that they have a problem
    or they have no intention of changing, either because they are unwilling to
    change or they are convinced that change is impossible. An example would
    be someone who is very overweight and is convinced that nothing can be
    done about it. (So why bother trying?)
**2. Contemplation**. At this stage, the individual intends to change sometime
    soon (for example, in the next six months). The person is aware of the ben-
    efits of changing but is also still focused on the possible costs. An example
    is a smoker who’s thinking about quitting in a few months.
**3. Preparation**. At this stage, the person is ready to change in the near future
    (for example, in the next month). The benefits of change are much more
    obvious to the person than the costs of changing. An example is someone
    who has decided to join a gym in a couple of weeks to become more fit.
**4. Action**. At this stage, the individual actually takes steps to change a problem
    behavior. For example, an individual who feels depressed might start to see
    a therapist for depression.


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
**5. Maintenance**. At this stage, the individual has made the change and is taking
    steps to prevent the problem behavior from returning. An example would be
    an individual with a history of problem drinking who has now been sober for
    six months and has stopped spending time with people who drink excessive
    amounts of alcohol.

Although this model has been studied mostly in people who are working on chang-
ing health habits (for example, exercise, diet, substance abuse, improving medication
compliance), it can also be applied to your treatment for shyness and social anxiety. The
further along you are with respect to these stages of change, the more likely you will
be to benefit from the strategies described in this book. For example, if you are in the
action stage, you will likely get more out of this book than if you are at the precontem-
plation stage and have no intention of making any changes.
Of course, these stages overlap with one another, and deciding which stage you are
in is not always so clean cut. In fact, you may be at a different stage for different aspects
of your social anxiety. You may be convinced that it is completely impossible that you
will ever be able to date (precontemplation), but you may be thinking about working on
finding a better job over the next few months (contemplation). You may also have already
signed up for a night class so you can start to meet new friends (action). Fortunately, as
you make changes in some areas, you may discover that you become more ready to make
changes in other areas as well.
Success at changing your social anxiety will require that you are willing, able, and
ready to take action (Miller and Rollnick 2002). Being _willing_ means that the change is
important to you, and that this is a change you want to make. Being _able_ means that you
are confident in your ability to make the change (once you have been given the right
tools and strategies). Being _ready_ means that this is a high priority for you, and that you
are prepared to put other priorities aside for now in order to get this done. Use the scale
below to rate the extent to which you are willing, able, and ready to make this change.
For each rating, you may use any number from 0 to 100.

COSTS AND BENEFITS OF OVERCOMING

YOUR ANXIETY

For the majority of people, the benefits of using the strategies described in this book
will far outweigh the costs. If you didn’t believe that, you probably wouldn’t be reading
this book. Still, you may have mixed feelings about changing, and therefore it may be
helpful to think about your reasons for change, as well as your reasons for not changing.
We will start with a discussion of the potential costs of change.

Costs of Overcoming Your Social Anxiety

In this section, we discuss the costs of changing. As you go through this section,
notice that these potential costs are mostly short-term inconveniences that are only
present while you are actively working on your anxiety. As your anxiety improves, these
costs will fade as well. Also, instead of thinking about these as _costs_ , it is helpful to think
of them as _challenges_. After all, most of these costs are manageable, and there are often
possible solutions available to minimize their impact.

**Costs of medication treatments.** If you choose to use medications, you will have to
remember to take them regularly, and newer medications may be expensive, particularly
if they are not covered by your health plan. You may experience side effects. Depending
on the medication, side effects may include fatigue, headaches, changes in weight and
appetite, and changes in sexual functioning. Of course, as you will learn in chapter 5,
many of the side effects associated with medications are worst in the first few weeks,
improve over time, and are generally quite manageable. Side effects can also be mini-
mized by adjusting doses, changing medications, or stopping medications altogether.

**Costs of psychological treatments.** Psychological treatments, such as confronting the
situations that you fear, are also associated with costs. First, they are time-consuming.
To get the most out of exposure-based treatments, for example, you may need to prac-
tice for an hour or more, three to five days per week. Also, psychological treatments
can be expensive (especially in the short term), depending on your insurance coverage
and the fees charged by the therapist. In addition, conducting exposure practices will
probably make you feel anxious and uncomfortable, particularly at the start. Although
the exercises are designed so that the discomfort is usually manageable, at times your
fear may be intense. In addition to feeling uncomfortable, you may feel more tired, espe-
cially on days when you practice confronting situations that make you uncomfortable.
You also may feel irritable and perhaps even have anxiety-provoking dreams. Finally,
your improvement may not follow a smooth course. It is likely the changes will take
time and you may have periods (days, weeks, or even months) during which you feel as
though you’re slipping backward. For many people this is a normal part of the process


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
of overcoming social anxiety. By continuing to use the strategies described in this book,
however, your anxiety should continue to improve over time.

**Other possible costs of improving.** Overcoming your anxiety may also have an impact
on other areas of your life. In most cases, the impact will be positive, but there may be
some costs associated with these changes as well. If you are in a long-term relationship,
you might find that your partner will need time to adjust to the changes you are making.
For example, as you become more comfortable socializing, you may be out more often
with friends or coworkers. If your partner is accustomed to having you around most of
the time, these changes may require some getting used to. It may be helpful to discuss
the changes that you are making openly with your partner, friends, and family members,
if appropriate. This will demonstrate to them that you are sensitive to how the improve-
ments in your social anxiety may affect them.

Can you think of other possible costs of overcoming your social anxiety, shyness, or
performance-related fears? If so, record them in the following space.

Benefits of Overcoming Your Social Anxiety

Fortunately, there are also benefits of overcoming your social anxiety. As we men-
tioned in the last section, the costs of overcoming your anxiety are usually just short-
term inconveniences. On the other hand, the benefits of change tend to be much more
long lasting. What this book challenges you to do is to decide whether you are willing to
tolerate some short-term pain, to achieve long-term gains. Examples of potential benefits
of overcoming your shyness and social anxiety include the following:

```
UÊ Learning to feel more comfortable in feared social and performance
situations
```
```
UÊ Meeting new friends
```
```
UÊ Improving the quality of your relationships
```
```
UÊ Learning to network more comfortably in situations related to your job or
career
```
```
UÊ Expanding the possible options for what you can do in your leisure time
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Improving your job prospects (for instance, realizing new opportunities to
get a promotion or to seek a higher-paying position)
```
```
UÊ Opening up some opportunities for self-improvement by furthering your
education
```
```
UÊ Learning to increase your enjoyment of life
```
```
UÊ Feeling more confident
```
```
UÊ Increasing your ability to express yourself
```
```
UÊ Learning strategies that you may be able to apply to other problems, such
as anger, depression, or a troubled relationship
```
Based on this list of examples, or others that you can identify, can you think of
benefits that would result from overcoming your social anxiety? Focus on benefits that
are based on your own _internal values and goals_ (for example, “I want to have closer friend-
ships”), rather than the values and goals of others (for example, “My mother wants me
to make new friends”). Questions like the ones listed below can be useful as you identify
your own reasons for changing:

```
UÊ How would I like my life to be different in five years?
```
```
UÊ What would be better about my life if I felt more comfortable in social
situation s?
```
```
UÊ What type of person would I like to be, and how is my social anxiety pre-
venting me from being that type of person?
```
```
UÊ What sorts of things do I miss about my life before social anxiety became
as big a problem as it is now?
```
Record your reasons for changing in the space below.

Now that you have had a chance to consider the costs and benefits of working on
your social anxiety, you are in a better position to make a commitment to working on
overcoming your fears. Assuming that you have decided to go ahead as planned, the
remainder of this chapter will help you to consider the strategies best suited to your
individual needs.


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
SETTING GOALS FOR CHANGE

Without setting specific goals or objectives, it will be impossible for you to evaluate
whether you’re making the changes that you hope to make. Goals can be described in a
number of different ways. First, goals can reflect either _short-term_ or l _ong-term_ changes that
you would like to accomplish. For example, if you have a fear of public speaking, a rea-
sonable one-week goal might be to ask a single question at a meeting at work, regardless
of how anxious you feel. A six-month goal might be to give a thirty-minute presentation
without feeling significant anxiety. As you go through the process of overcoming your
social anxiety, it is important to identify short-term goals (for example, what you want to
accomplish this week), medium-range goals (such as what you want to accomplish over
the next few months), and long-range goals (for instance, what you want to accomplish
over the next year or two).
Goals also can be described either as _specific_ or _general_. A specific goal is more detailed
than a general one. Therefore, specific goals are often better suited for guiding you in
selecting appropriate treatment strategies, compared with general goals. Also, with spe-
cific goals, it is easier to measure whether your objectives are being met. Although it is
okay to have a few general goals, you also should try to generate as many specific goals
as possible. Examples of general and specific goals are listed below.

```
General Goal Specific Goal
```
To be more comfortable during
presentations

```
To have my fear level during presentations at my
weekly sales meetings decrease from a level of 100
out of 100 to a level of 40 out of 100
```
To ask someone on a date
sometime

```
To ask John (or Jane) to have dinner with me by the
end of this month
```
To have more friends To meet at least three new friends by the end of this
year, with whom I can see movies or watch sports

To be comfortable in crowds To be able to walk through a crowded mall or on a
crowded street with my fear below a 30 or 40 out
of 100

To cope better with criticism To be able to tolerate negative feedback on my
annual performance review at work without becom-
ing very upset and while still paying attention to all
my positive achievements over the year

To ask questions in class To ask at least one question during each class over
the rest of this semester

To deal better with groups To be able to make small talk at a party while main-
taining eye contact and speaking loudly enough for
others to hear


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Now, think about what types of changes you would like to make. Specifically, think
about aspects of your social anxiety (anxious beliefs, situations that you avoid, and so
on) that you would like to change. Try to be realistic. Also, recognize that your goals
may change. For example, right now you may not need to make presentations in your
daily life. However, if you take a job that involves public speaking, your goals may have
to be revised later to reflect this change.
We have included space for you to record your goals for the next month as well as
your goals for one year from now. Of course, if you prefer, you may choose other time
periods. The main point to remember is that you may have different short-term and
long-term goals. Although some goals may be realistic targets for a year or two from
now, they may not be realistic goals for one week or one month from now.

REVIEWING PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS TO TREAT

YOUR SOCIAL ANXIETY

This section has two purposes. First, if you’ve tried to overcome your social anxiety in
the past, it will help you review the treatments that worked for you and those that were
not especially helpful. Second, this section will help you to identify possible reasons
why certain previous attempts to overcome your social anxiety were not useful, if this
was your experience. By identifying the reasons for previously successful and not-so-
successful treatment attempts, you will be able to make more educated decisions about
what types of strategies to try now. If a treatment has worked well in the past, you may
want to try it again. If you did not benefit from a particular treatment previously, you
may want to try something new. However, you should still consider giving a particular
treatment another try if you didn’t give it a fair chance the first time.
In the spaces that follow, check off any treatments that you have tried in the past.
Also, describe the treatment and record whether the outcome was helpful.

If yes, describe the treatment. (For instance, what book/s did you

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Now that you have identified specific treatments you have tried in the past, the next
step is to understand why a treatment was ineffective or only partially effective, if that
was your experience. Listed below are some of the reasons why psychological treatments
and medications are occasionally not helpful.

```
Why Psychological Treatments Sometimes Don’t Help
```
```
UÊ The therapy is an ineffective treatment for social anxiety. Many types of
psychotherapy have never been studied for the treatment of social anxiety,
and others have been found to be of little benefit. (Cognitive behavioral
therapy is the best-studied approach and is well supported.)
```
```
UÊ The therapist is inexperienced either with the type of therapy being offered
or the treatment of shyness and social anxiety, in particular.
```
```
UÊ The frequency and intensity of exposure practices is too low. If you practice
exposure to social situations too infrequently, you will be less likely to see
the desired results.
```
```
UÊ The treatment does not last long enough. You may not have benefited from
previous therapy if you dropped out of treatment before positive results
could be seen.
```
```
UÊ An individual expects the treatment to be ineffective. There is evidence that
a person’s expectations can affect the outcome of psychotherapy (Safren,
Heimberg, and Juster 1997).
```
```
UÊ The person does not comply with the treatment. If you miss sessions, arrive
late for sessions, or don’t complete homework, therapy is less likely to be
effective.
```
```
UÊ There are other problems or stresses in the person’s life that interfere with
treatment (for example, severe depression, alcohol abuse, stressful job,
marital problems, health issues).
```
```
Why Medications Sometimes Don’t Help
```
```
UÊ It is the wrong medication for the problem. Some medications have been
shown to be more effective than others for treating social anxiety (see
chapter 5). Furthermore, a medication that works for one person may not
be the best choice for someone else.
```
```
UÊ The medication dosage is not high enough.
```
```
UÊ The treatment does not last long enough. Some medications can take up to
six weeks to have an effect. Also, stopping certain medications too soon can
increase the chances of the anxiety coming back.
```

```
Making a Plan for Change
```
```
UÊ An individual expects the treatment to be ineffective. As with psychother-
apy, there is evidence that a person’s response to medication is affected by
his or her expectations.
```
```
UÊ The side effects are too unpleasant to tolerate.
```
```
UÊ The person is using drugs, drinking alcohol, or taking other medications
that influence the effects of the medication for social anxiety.
```
```
UÊ The person doesn’t comply with the treatment (for example, misses pills).
```
If you have tried to overcome your social anxiety in the past, but found treatment
to be ineffective or only partially effective, do you have any guesses about why it may
not have worked as well as you had hoped it would? Based on your previous experiences
with therapy or medication, are there strategies that you want to try again?

PROVEN STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING

SOCIAL ANXIETY

There are hundreds of different approaches that people have used to overcome emo-
tional difficulties, behavior problems, and bad habits. Some of these approaches include
psychotherapy, medications, prayer, relaxation training, yoga, hypnosis, distraction,
drinking alcohol or using drugs, exercise, changing diet, reward and punishment, herbal
remedies, traditional remedies, acupuncture, education and reading about the problem,
past-life regression, and so forth. Furthermore, each of these methods can be subdivided
into even more categories. For example, there are many different types of psychotherapy
and medications, some of which are more useful than others for a particular problem.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Given all of the different available options, it can be very difficult for a consumer to
select the best approach for overcoming a particular problem.
For most of the methods listed previously, there is almost no controlled research
examining their use in treating anxiety in general and social anxiety in particular. The
term _controlled_ is used to describe studies in which the investigators have examined the
effects of a particular treatment while taking steps to ensure that any improvements that
occur are, in fact, due to the treatment, rather than to other factors. Note that a lack
of controlled research does not mean that a particular treatment is ineffective. It simply
means we just don’t know whether the treatment works or how well it works.
Even if someone seems to improve after using one of these methods, it can be dif-
ficult to know whether it was the treatment that had a beneficial effect or whether other
factors contributed to the change. For example, as we mentioned earlier, someone’s
expectations of improving during treatment can affect his or her improvement. Other
reasons why people might improve with a particular treatment may include the passage
of time. For some types of problems (such as depression), the symptoms may improve
naturally over time, regardless of whether the sufferer receives any specific treatments.
Changes in a person’s normal routines (for instance, a reduction of stress at work) also
can contribute to improvements over and above any treatment effects.
Properly controlled research can help to determine whether the effects of a treat-
ment are indeed due to the treatment rather than to other factors. One strategy used by
researchers is the inclusion of a control group. For example, research studies that examine
the effects of a medication on a particular problem usually give a percentage of the individ-
uals in the study a _placebo_ , which is, essentially, a pill that contains no real medication. This
group is called the _placebo control group_. Typically, neither the doctor nor the patient knows
whether the person is taking a placebo or the real medication until after the study ends.
The test of whether a medication is helpful depends on how well people who took
the medication respond compared with those who took the placebo. Including a placebo
control group allows the researcher to directly measure the effects of the medication over
and above the effects of the individual’s expectations about the treatment. Properly con-
ducted studies examining the effects of psychological treatments also include appropriate
control groups to aid in understanding why a particular treatment may appear to work.
In this book, we have chosen to focus on techniques that have been shown in con-
trolled research to be effective for helping people to overcome problems with social
anxiety, shyness, and performance-related fears. In other words, these techniques have
been shown to be effective compared with no treatment, placebo treatments, other forms
of psychotherapy, or other appropriate control groups. The techniques we will focus on
include two main groups of strategies: cognitive behavioral therapy and medications.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, includes a group of techniques that are usually
used together as a package. Numerous studies have shown that CBT is an effective


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
way of overcoming social anxiety (for reviews, see Antony and Rowa 2008; Rodebaugh,
Holaway, and Heimberg 2004). Cognitive behavioral therapy differs from other more
traditional forms of therapy in the following ways:

```
UÊ CBT is directive. In other words, the therapist is actively involved in the
therapy and makes very specific suggestions.
```
```
UÊ CBT’s focus is on changing a particular problem. Some other forms of therapy
focus on helping the individual develop insight into or understanding of the
deep-rooted causes of a problem but do not offer specific strategies for
overcoming the problem.
```
```
UÊ CBT has a relatively brief duration. The typical course for social anxiety is
ten to twenty sessions.
```
```
UÊ CBT focuses on current beliefs and behaviors, which are thought to be
responsible for maintaining the problem. Some traditional therapies tend to
focus more on early childhood experiences.
```
```
UÊ In CBT, the therapist and client are partners and work together during
treatment.
```
```
UÊ In CBT, the client chooses the goals for therapy, with input from the
therapist.
```
```
UÊ CBT usually includes strategies for measuring progress so that treatment
techniques can be adjusted for maximum effectiveness.
```
```
UÊ CBT involves changing beliefs and behaviors so that the client is able to
better manage anxiety and to navigate anxiety-provoking situations.
```
Cognitive behavioral therapy for social anxiety includes three main types of strat-
egies. Treatment almost always includes cognitive therapy and exposure to feared
situations. In addition, social-skills training is sometimes included.

```
COGNITIVE THERAPY
```
The term _cognitive_ refers to anything having to do with assumptions, beliefs, predic-
tions, interpretations, visual imagery, memory, and other mental processes related to
thinking. The basic underlying assumption of cognitive therapy is that negative emotions
occur because people interpret situations in a negative or threatening way. For example,
people who are convinced that others will judge them in a negative way or who are
overly concerned about the opinions of others are bound to feel anxious or uncomfort-
able in certain social situations. Cognitive therapy teaches individuals to be more aware
of their negative thoughts and to replace them with less negative thoughts. People learn


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

to treat their beliefs as guesses about the way things may be, rather than as facts. They
are taught to examine the evidence supporting their anxious beliefs and to consider the
possibility that an alternative belief is true.
For example, if Henry is very hurt and angry because a friend didn’t return his call,
these negative feelings might stem from Henry’s belief that the friend doesn’t care about
him. In cognitive therapy, Henry would be taught to consider alternative explanations
for the friend’s behavior, including the possibility that the friend never received the
message, forgot to return the call, or is out of town. After all, there are many possible
reasons why a caring friend might not have returned Henry’s call quickly.
At the beginning of treatment, diaries are used to record anxious thoughts and to
counter them with more realistic predictions and interpretations. As people become
more comfortable with the methods of challenging their unrealistic negative beliefs, their
new ways of thinking become more automatic and the diaries are no longer needed.
People learn to manage their anxious thoughts before they get out of control. Cognitive
therapy techniques are described in detail in chapter 6.

```
EXPOSURE
```
Exposure involves gradually and repeatedly confronting feared situations until they
no longer trigger fear. In most cases, exposure is viewed as a necessary component of
CBT. In fact, exposure may be even more powerful than cognitive therapy as a way of
changing anxious negative thinking. By exposing yourself to situations you fear, you
will learn that the risk in these situations is minimal. Through direct experience, many
of your anxious predictions and beliefs will be proven incorrect. You will also learn
to better tolerate situations in which some of your beliefs actually may be true (for
example, when another person actually does judge you negatively). Finally, exposure will
provide you with an opportunity to practice your cognitive therapy skills and to improve
upon any social or communication skills that may be rusty from having avoided social
situations for so long. See chapters 7 through 9 for detailed instructions for designing
and implementing exposure exercises.

```
IMPROVING SOCIAL SKILLS
```
Social-skills training refers to the process of learning to improve the quality of your
communication as well as other social behaviors, so there will be an increased likelihood
of obtaining a positive response from others. Note that most people who are socially
anxious have better social skills than they think they do. In fact, formal social-skills train-
ing is often not included in CBT programs, and people undergoing the treatment still
respond quite well. Still, there is evidence that some people can benefit from learning a
few new techniques to become more assertive, make small talk more effectively, improve
their eye contact, and learn basic skills for dating or meeting new people. Chapter 10
describes strategies for improving social and communication skills.


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
Medications

Numerous medications have been shown to be effective for treating social phobia
(Van Ameringen, Mancini, and Patterson, in press). Mostly, these include certain anti-
depressants that also target anxiety (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine) and certain
anti-anxiety drugs (for instance, clonazepam). Typically, medications are taken on a
daily basis. To varying degrees, all medications are associated with certain side effects.
However, for most people, these side effects are quite manageable and most tend to
decrease over time.

Other Treatments

There are a number of other therapies that have preliminary or limited research
support for treating social anxiety. Some of these treatments are quite new, and all of
them have only been investigated in one or more studies for social anxiety (most of
which are not controlled studies). Though it is too early to know if these therapies are as
effective as CBT and medications, here are some brief descriptions of these approaches:

```
MINDFULNESS TRAINING
```
Mindfulness training involves learning to focus on one’s present experiences (for
example, thoughts and feelings) without judging them or trying to change them and
without dwelling on the past or anticipating the future (see Orsillo and Roemer 2005).
Meditation is often a component of mindfulness training. Preliminary evidence sup-
ports the use of mindfulness for treating general worries (Roemer and Orsillo 2007)
and for preventing relapse in depression (Williams et al. 2007). Evidence from a recent
pilot study suggests that mindfulness training may be useful for treating social anxiety
(Bögels, Sijbers, and Voncken 2006).

```
ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY (ACT)
```
ACT is a relatively new form of therapy that is related to mindfulness training in
that a goal of this treatment is to teach people to accept their experiences (includ-
ing emotions, thoughts, imagery, and other experiences) rather than trying to control,
fight, or change them (Hayes and Smith 2005). Mindfulness training is used as part of
ACT, but other strategies are used as well. In addition to acceptance, people receiving
ACT are also encouraged to make a commitment to live a life that is consistent with
their own values and goals, which typically involves changing behaviors. Though ACT
is often presented as an alternative to CBT, it actually overlaps with CBT quite a bit.
For example, ACT for anxiety and CBT for anxiety both use exposure as a component
(Eifert and Forsyth 2005). A preliminary, uncontrolled study suggests that ACT may
lead to reductions in social anxiety (Ossman et al. 2006).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
APPLIED RELAXATION TRAINING
```
Applied relaxation involves the combination of learning to relax the muscles of the
body with exposure to increasingly challenging situations. A few studies suggest that
applied muscle relaxation may be useful for social anxiety ( Jerremalm, Johansson, and
Öst, 1980; Osberg 1981). However, it is difficult to know whether this approach is effec-
tive because of the relaxation component, the exposure to feared situations, or both.
There are no studies investigating whether relaxation training adds any benefit over and
above the effects of exposure alone.

```
INTERPERSONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY (IPT)
```
IPT is a brief therapy that focuses exclusively on interpersonal aspects of a person’s
problem, such as problems in the individual’s relationships with others. IPT has been
studied primarily in people who are depressed, and it’s been shown in a number of well-
controlled studies to be an effective treatment for depression, as well as certain other
problems (Weissman, Markowitz, and Klerman 2007). Because of the interpersonal focus
of IPT, some researchers have wondered whether it might also be effective for treating
social anxiety. A preliminary, uncontrolled study (Lipsitz et al. 1999) suggests that IPT
may be useful for treating social anxiety, though more research is needed.

CHOOSING AMONG TREATMENT OPTIONS

If you decide to try medications, you will probably need to get a prescription from a
physician—usually your family doctor or a psychiatrist. However, note that in some
states other professionals (for example, nurse practitioners) may be able to prescribe
medications. In fact, two states (New Mexico and Louisiana) now allow psychologists
with appropriate training to prescribe medications as well. For most people, a visit to
your family doctor is a good place to start if you are interested in trying medications.
He or she can make a referral to a psychiatrist or other professional if needed. If you
are interested in trying a psychological treatment such as CBT, you have the option of
trying to overcome the problem on your own or seeking professional help.

Self-Help or Professional Help?

For some people, a self-help approach such as that described in this book may be
sufficient. In fact, a study by Moore, Braddock, and Abramowitz (2007) found that
most people who used the first edition of this book achieved significant reduction in
their social anxiety, even without any additional therapy. However, for others, a self-help
book alone is not enough, and many people find that the added structure and support
provided by a therapist is important. If you decide to seek professional help, this book


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
can still help to reinforce what you learn in therapy. An important part of CBT involves
educating the client (often using self-help readings) and encouraging the client to prac-
tice the various CBT techniques between sessions. In other words, CBT conducted with
a therapist often includes a self-help component. Combining a self-help book with your
therapy may even reduce the number of therapy sessions needed (Rapee et al. 2007).
For more information on finding a therapist, see the section on seeking professional help
that appears later in this chapter.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Other Psychotherapy?

In almost all cases, we recommend cognitive therapy and exposure as the psycho-
logical treatment of choice for social phobia. Adding social-skills training to the program
may be useful for some individuals as well. As for other psychological therapies, although
they certainly have a place for treating certain types of problems, they are not sufficiently
proven when it comes to treating social phobia and other anxiety-related conditions.
Some people with whom we have worked have reported benefits from combining
CBT with another form of psychotherapy. In these cases, typically they have seen one
therapist for CBT and another for dealing with other issues (for example, marital prob-
lems, coping with childhood abuse). Although this approach sometimes works well, we
recommend that your two therapists stay in close contact with each other so that they
can ensure they are not giving you contradictory messages during therapy.

Medication or CBT?

A number of studies have investigated whether CBT, medications, or their combina-
tion work best (Antony and Rowa 2008). Although there are some differences across
studies, the overall pattern of findings has been that all three of these approaches are
about equally effective, at least in the short term. For example, in the largest study
conducted to date, CBT, fluoxetine (an antidepressant), and a combination of fluoxetine
and CBT were all found to be about equally effective and were all more effective than
placebo (Davidson et al. 2004).
Although these approaches are about equally effective in the short term, CBT tends
to be a more effective treatment than medications over the long term (Liebowitz et al.
1999). In other words, once all treatments have stopped, people who have been only
taking medications are more likely to experience a return of symptoms than people who
had CBT.
Also, just because these three approaches are about equally effective _on average_ , that
doesn’t mean that they are equally likely to be effective _for you_. Some people seem to do
better with medications, whereas others seem to do best with CBT or a combination of
these approaches. The approach we usually recommend is to start with either CBT or
medication, and then introduce the other treatment after several months, if needed.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Group or Individual Therapy?

Cognitive behavioral therapy can be delivered either individually or in groups. Both
approaches work well. Although most studies have found group and individual thera-
pies for social anxiety to be about equally effective, some have found an advantage for
individual therapy (for a review, see Bieling, McCabe, and Antony 2006).
Regardless of which approach you choose, you should be aware of the advantages
and disadvantages of each. Group treatment gives people an opportunity to meet other
people with the same problem. This allows people to learn from the mistakes and suc-
cesses of others and reminds them that they are not the only ones suffering from this
problem. Group treatment also provides clients with opportunities to interact with other
individuals who can participate in exposure exercises and role-play practices. For example,
group members can be an audience during exposures that involve giving presentations.
The cost is another advantage of group therapy. Because you are sharing the thera-
pist’s time with other people, the cost per session is often lower than for individual
therapy. If you decide to enter group treatment for social anxiety, we recommend that
you try to find a group that focuses exclusively on anxiety problems, and ideally on
social anxiety (rather than a group that includes people who suffer from a wide range of
different problems). You are most likely to find a specialized social anxiety group at an
anxiety disorders specialty clinic.
Individual therapy also has advantages. First, it can be less scary than group therapy,
particularly at the beginning. As you can imagine, people with social phobia are often
quite terrified of starting group treatment, although anxiety about speaking in front
of the group usually diminishes after the first few weeks. Furthermore, with individual
therapy, you don’t have to share your time with other group members. And, because
there is more time to focus on you, the program can be individually tailored to suit your
personal needs. Individual therapy also has advantages from a scheduling perspective. If
you miss a session due to illness or vacation, usually you can just reschedule an individual
appointment. In contrast, if you miss a group session, catching up on the material that
you missed may be more complicated.
Whether you decide to seek group or individual treatment should depend on a
careful weighing of all of these factors. Keep in mind, however, that you may not have a
choice. Although the availability of CBT is increasing, this form of therapy is still hard
to find in some places, either in a group or individual format. We would like to empha-
size that, in choosing a therapy, the most important factor is finding a therapist who has
experience in providing CBT for social anxiety. Whether you choose group or individual
therapy should be a secondary issue, since both seem to work well.

THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULAR PRACTICE

Although simply reading about how to overcome social phobia may be helpful, to make
big changes in your social anxiety, it will be necessary for you to actually practice the


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
techniques described throughout this book. For example, you will get more out of
the cognitive strategies described in chapter 6 if you complete the monitoring forms
and diaries and frequently take advantage of opportunities to challenge your anxious
beliefs.
To get the most out of exposure practices, it will be important to enter feared
situations as frequently as possible and to stay in the feared situations until your fear
has decreased, or until you learn that your feared consequences don’t occur. Many of
your exposure practices can be conducted during the course of your everyday life (for
instance, having lunch with coworkers instead of eating alone), but other practices may
require you to set aside time just for the exposure exercises.

INCLUDING A HELPER OR CO-THERAPIST

It may be helpful to involve a helper or “co-therapist” in your treatment, for example,
a friend, coworker, or family member. Your helper can provide you with opportunities
to practice role-play exposures, such as presentations, simulated job interviews, making
small talk, or asking another person out on a date. In addition, he or she can provide you
with honest feedback about your performance and offer suggestions for improvement.
When choosing other people to help you out, we suggest that you select people
whom you trust. The person should be someone who is supportive and unlikely to
become frustrated or angry if things move slowly or if you are finding a particular situa-
tion difficult or anxiety provoking. If possible, your helper should read relevant sections
of this book so that he or she has a better understanding of the treatment and how it
works. If this is not practical, an alternative option would be to have you describe to your
helper what his or her role will be during the practices.

DEALING WITH ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS

Many people who suffer from social anxiety also experience other problems, includ-
ing other anxiety disorders, depression, alcohol or drug use problems, and relationship
difficulties. In most cases, these other problems tend not to interfere with the treatment
of social anxiety. However, if you are currently suffering from problems in addition
to your shyness, there are two questions that you should consider. First, is your social
anxiety the most important problem to focus on currently? If not, you should probably
focus on the problem that is interfering the most with your life. For example, if your
depression is more severe than your social anxiety, it may be important to deal with your
depression first and then turn your attention to the social anxiety when your depression
is under control. Second, are your other problems so severe that they are likely to get in
the way of your social anxiety treatment? If so, you should work on the other problems
first. For example, if you are drinking alcohol so frequently that you’re unlikely to follow


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

through with the exercises in this book, then dealing with your drinking before working
on your social anxiety is a good idea.

SEEKING PROFESSIONAL HELP

If you are interested in seeking professional help for your social anxiety, here are some
additional suggestions to keep in mind.

How to Find a Therapist or Doctor

One of the most difficult aspects of finding a therapist or doctor is knowing where
to look. A good place to begin is with your family doctor, who will likely be aware
of psychiatrists, psychologists, and anxiety specialty clinics in your area. You may also
want to call nearby hospitals and clinics to see if they have programs that offer either
CBT or medication for social anxiety. The Internet is also a great source of information
about treatment options in your area. Check with your insurance company about the
rules regarding coverage for treatment of psychological conditions. Your plan may have
restrictions regarding who you can see and the number of sessions that are covered.
Another way to find help is to contact a national organization that focuses either
on anxiety-related problems or CBT. For example, the Anxiety Disorders Association of
America (www.adaa.org) offers information about treatment options and self-help groups
across the United States and Canada (the ADAA has both consumer and professional
members). The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.abct.org) is
a professional organization that also provides information on practitioners who treat
anxiety-related problems. Full contact information for these and other organizations is
provided in the resources section at the back of this book. You may also contact your
state psychological or psychiatric associations to get information about psychologists or
psychiatrists in your area.
When choosing a professional, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Before making a
commitment, here are some issues that you should clarify:

```
UÊ The type of treatment being offered. For example, if you are interested in a
psychological treatment, you should ask whether the person is experienced
in providing CBT for social and performance anxiety.
```
```
UÊ The typical number of sessions recommended for treating this problem, rec-
ognizing that it is often difficult to know this before conducting a thorough
assessment. In many cases, ten to twenty sessions is enough.
```
```
UÊ The length of each session. One-hour sessions are typical, though longer
time periods are sometimes needed for exposure sessions.
```

```
Making a Plan for Change
```
```
UÊ The frequency of sessions. Weekly sessions are typical.
```
```
UÊ The cost per session and preferred method of payment. Are the fees
flexible?
```
```
UÊ The location and setting. For example, is the treatment conducted in
a private office? A hospital? A university clinic? A community clinic? A
research center?
```
```
UÊ The availability of group vs. individual treatments for social anxiety. Either
approach is likely to help.
```
```
UÊ Who provides the treatment? A psychologist? Psychiatrist? Psychology
student or psychiatric resident? How experienced is the person? Where
was he or she trained? If it is a student therapist, how closely is he or she
supervised? How experienced is the supervisor? Can you meet with the
supervisor if you wish?
```
Types of Professionals

If you are interested in receiving a psychological therapy, like CBT, your therapist
can be a psychologist, physician, nurse, social worker, or professional from any of a
number of other backgrounds. However, keep in mind that most practicing clinicians,
regardless of their background, do not have extensive experience in providing CBT
for anxiety-related problems. It is much more important that you find someone who is
familiar with treating social anxiety using cognitive and exposure-based treatments than
what degree the person has. Currently, psychologists are the most likely to have this
background, but other professionals are increasingly being trained in providing cognitive
and behavioral treatments.
Understanding the differences between types of therapists often can be confusing.
A brief description of some of the main professionals who often provide CBT and related
treatments follows:

**Psychologist.** In most places, psychologists who specialize in treating psychological dis-
orders usually have a doctoral degree in clinical or counseling psychology. Often, this
degree is a Ph.D. (which includes significant training in both research and in providing
clinical care), although it may also be a Psy.D. (indicating a primary training focus on
providing clinical services and relatively less emphasis on research) or an Ed.D. (indi-
cating training that stems from an educational psychology perspective). Typically, the
training of a psychologist includes an undergraduate bachelor’s degree (four years), fol-
lowed by an additional five to eight years of graduate training. In some states and prov-
inces, psychology practitioners with a master’s degree (usually two years of graduate
training) can also call themselves psychologists, whereas in other places, master’s level


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

clinicians are called by other terms (for example, psychological associate, psychothera-
pist, psychometrist).

**Psychiatrist.** A psychiatrist is a physician who has specialized in treating mental health
problems after completing four years of medical school. Typically, this specialty train-
ing includes a five-year residency and also may include additional fellowship training.
Psychiatrists are more likely than other types of professionals to understand and treat
anxiety from a biological perspective, although increasingly, psychiatric training pro-
grams are requiring training in CBT. Advantages of being treated by a psychiatrist over
other types of professionals include the opportunity to obtain medications in addition
to other forms of therapy, as well as the opportunity to be assessed by a physician who
is uniquely qualified to recognize medical conditions that may be contributing to the
problem.

**Social worker.** Social workers are trained to do many different things including helping
people to deal better with their relationships, solve their personal and family problems,
and learn to cope better with day-to-day stresses. They may help people to deal with
the stresses of inadequate housing, unemployment, lack of job skills, financial distress,
serious illness or disability, substance abuse, unwanted pregnancy, and other hardships.
Most social workers specialize, and some end up providing psychotherapy either in a
private practice or a hospital or agency setting. Although CBT is seldom a formal part
of social-work training programs, some social workers obtain specialized training in CBT
following their formal schooling.

**Other professions.** Professionals from a variety of other groups may be trained to
provide CBT or other forms of psychotherapy. These include some family physicians,
nurses, occupational therapists, clergy or other religious leaders, and even psychothera-
pists without any formal degree in a mental-health related field. As mentioned earlier,
it is more important to know whether the person you’re seeing has the experience and
expertise in treating social anxiety using strategies that have been proven to be useful
than whether the person is a nurse, family doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, occupational
therapist, social worker, or a student in one of these fields.

FINAL QUESTIONS REGARDING TREATMENT

OF SOCIAL ANXIETY

Here are some answers to a few additional frequently asked questions.

**How long does treatment take?** As mentioned earlier, cognitive behavioral treatment
for social and performance anxiety typically takes between ten and twenty sessions.
Sometimes a person may make significant gains after just three or four sessions, par-
ticularly if the fear is very mild. Other times, treatment may last many months or even


```
Making a Plan for Change
```
years. If you are being treated with medication (particularly antidepressants), it is usually
recommended that you stay on the medication for six months to a year or more before
slowly decreasing the dosage and eventually discontinuing the medication. If the symp-
toms return, it may be necessary to resume taking the medication or to try a different
form of treatment.

**Are the effects of treatment long lasting?** As we discussed earlier, the effects of CBT
tend to be relatively long lasting, although you may experience some bad days occasion-
ally. In contrast, stopping medication treatment suddenly is more likely to lead to a return
of the anxiety. You can protect against this to some degree by staying on the medication
for a longer period (perhaps at a reduced “maintenance” dosage) and by stopping the
medication very gradually. Also, stopping certain types of medications is more likely to
lead to a return of symptoms than stopping other medications, as reviewed in chapter

5. It is advisable to discuss reducing or stopping medication with the professional who is
prescribing it for you before you change the dose you’re taking.

**Will you be completely “cured”?** A small percentage of people who have significant
social anxiety are able to reach a point at which they rarely experience any social anxiety
at all. Similarly, a small percentage of people do not obtain any benefit from either
CBT or medications. For most people, however, the result of treatment is somewhere in
between these two extremes. It is realistic to expect that proper treatment is likely to
lead to a significant decrease in your social anxiety, avoidance behaviors, and impairment
of day-to-day life. However, it is also likely that there will remain some situations that
will still be anxiety provoking, at least to some extent. This outcome may not seem too
bad if you remember that most people experience social and performance anxiety from
time to time.

**What if you don’t like your therapist or doctor?** Although it is unrealistic to expect
to be feeling better after only a few weeks, you should know after one or two meet-
ings whether you are comfortable working with your therapist or doctor. If you are not
pleased with how things are going, consider trying someone else. Within six to eight
weeks after beginning either CBT or medication, you should begin to see changes. If
changes have not occurred after two months, you should talk to your doctor or therapist
about the possible reasons for the lack of improvement and consider other treatment
options.

MEASURING CHANGE DURING TREATMENT

In chapter 3, we emphasized the importance of monitoring your progress throughout
your treatment program. We recommend that periodically (every few weeks) you reflect
on your progress by considering what types of changes you have made and what changes
remain to be accomplished. Depending on your progress, you may decide to revise your


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

treatment plan. You may also decide to update your treatment goals. We recommend
that you occasionally complete some of the forms in chapter 3 as a way of assessing
whether your social anxiety is improving.

DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE

TREATMENT PLAN

In chapters 1 and 2, you learned about the nature and causes of social anxiety. In chapter
3, you completed a thorough assessment of your own anxiety symptoms. Then, you
continued the self-assessment process throughout this chapter, as you reviewed your
previous attempts at treatment and developed your treatment goals. You are now ready
to develop a treatment plan. By now, you should have a good idea of what you need to
work on and whether you will try to overcome your social anxiety on your own or with
the help of a professional therapist or physician.
If you are considering trying medication, we recommend that you read chapter 5
next. Chapter 5 reviews the various medications that have been shown to be useful for
treating social and performance anxiety. If you are interested in trying cognitive behav-
ioral techniques, we suggest that you develop a treatment schedule for the next few
months. The following list is one example of such a schedule:

```
UÊ In the next week, read chapter 6 and begin to work on changing your neg-
ative thinking patterns. Chapter 6 includes a number of effective cogni-
tive strategies as well as diaries that you should complete several times per
week.
```
```
UÊ Continue to practice the cognitive strategies for two to three weeks before
moving on to exposure-based techniques (chapters 7 through 9).
```
```
UÊ When you are ready to begin exposure practices, begin reading chapters 7
and 8. As you read these chapters, you will have the opportunity to plan
exposures designed specifically for your own pattern of fear and avoidance.
We recommend that you practice the situational exposure strategies for five
or six weeks before moving on to chapter 9.
```
```
UÊ At the same time that you are practicing exposures, you should continue to
practice using the cognitive strategies that you will learn in chapter 6. By
using the cognitive strategies and practicing exposures to feared situations,
you should notice your fear beginning to decrease.
```
```
UÊ After five or six weeks of practicing exposure to feared situations, read
chapter 9 to learn more about how to expose yourself to feared physical
sensations. If you are frightened of feeling certain sensations when you are
anxious, we recommend that you spend two to three weeks practicing the
```

```
Making a Plan for Change
```
```
strategies described in chapter 9. At the same time, continue to practice the
cognitive and exposure techniques from the earlier chapters.
```
```
UÊ If there are social skills that you would like to improve, this will be the time
to use the exercises described in chapter 10. Again, we recommend that you
do not stop using the skills that you learned earlier, particularly the cogni-
tive and exposure-based strategies.
```
At this point, several months will have passed and your anxiety will be likely to have
improved significantly. We recommend that you read chapter 11 at this point, which
discusses ways of maintaining the gains you have made so far.
If you are curious and you want to read later sections in the book now, that’s fine.
However, it’s important that you go back and practice the strategies in each chapter
before moving on to the next set of techniques. These strategies are the building blocks
that eventually will lead to an improvement in your social anxiety.
After completing this chapter, a number of issues should be clearer to you. First, you
should have a better idea of whether this is the best time for you to work on overcoming
your social anxiety. Second, you should have formulated a number of treatment goals,
both for the short term and the long term. Finally, it is likely that you will have consid-
ered the various treatment options and identified your own treatment preferences. The
remaining chapters in this workbook provide more detailed instructions in how to take
advantage of particular strategies for managing social anxiety.



CHAPTER 5

### Medications for Social

### Anxiety and Social

### Anxiety Disorder

DECIDING TO TAKE MEDICATION

As discussed in earlier chapters, two approaches have been shown to be useful for over-
coming social anxiety: medications and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Chapter 4
reviewed the key points to keep in mind when deciding whether to use drug treatments
to overcome your symptoms of social anxiety. Medications and CBT have been shown
to be about equally effective in the short term for treating social anxiety. Still, each
approach has advantages and disadvantages.

```
Advantages of Medications Compared with CBT
```
```
UÊ Medications are often easier to get. Any physician (for example, family
doctor or psychiatrist) can prescribe medications, as can certain other pro-
fessionals. In contrast, therapists who have specialized training in providing
CBT are often more difficult to find.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Drug treatments are easy to use and don’t take up much time. You just need
to remember to take your pills. In contrast, CBT requires a lot of hard work
and can be time consuming.
```
```
UÊ Medications often work more quickly than CBT. Depending on the type of
drug, changes in anxiety can be observed in as little as an hour for treat-
ment with anti-anxiety medications, and in as little as two to four weeks
for treatment with antidepressant medications. Typically, CBT takes several
weeks to months before significant changes take place.
```
```
UÊ Medications are often less expensive in the short term. Visits to your doctor
can be infrequent once a stable dosage is reached. At that point, the only
cost is the medication itself. In contrast, CBT usually requires regular
visits to a therapist throughout the treatment and therefore can be costly,
especially if you have limited coverage through your health insurance.
```
```
Disadvantages of Medications Compared with CBT
```
```
UÊ Anxiety is more likely to return after stopping medication than after stop-
ping CBT. In other words, the effects of CBT are often longer lasting.
```
```
UÊ Medication may be more expensive than CBT over the long term. Because
medication is typically used for a longer period (often years), the costs are
likely to add up to more than the cost of CBT, which generally lasts only
several months.
```
```
UÊ Many people experience side effects when taking medications. Although
these are usually manageable and improve after the first few weeks, some
people experience more severe side effects, making treatment with medica-
tion unpleasant or impossible. The main side effect of CBT is an increase
in anxiety during exposure to feared situations, and this anxiety resolves
quickly.
```
```
UÊ Medications for social anxiety may interact with alcohol and with other
medications. They may also cause problems in people who have certain
medical illnesses. CBT does not interact in the same ways with alcohol,
medications, or medical illnesses.
```
```
UÊ Some medications are difficult to stop taking because they may cause
uncomfortable symptoms during discontinuation. This is particularly a
problem with anti-anxiety medications, as well as with a few specific anti-
depressants. Medications with the potential for dependence should be dis-
continued slowly, under supervision from your doctor. In contrast, physical
dependence and withdrawal problems are not associated with CBT.
```

```
Medications for Social Anxiety and Social Anxiety Disorder
```
```
UÊ Some medications (in particular, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) require a
restricted diet. CBT does not require any food restrictions.
```
```
UÊ Many medications must be either used with caution or avoided completely
during pregnancy or if you are breastfeeding. CBT can be used safely in
either of these situations.
```
In deciding whether to try medications, you should consult with your doctor. Keep
in mind, however, that your doctor’s advice regarding this issue is likely to be influenced
by his or her own expertise and preferences (for example, family doctors are often much
less familiar with research on CBT than with medication options). In reality, it’s very
difficult to predict who is most likely to respond to CBT or vs. medication, vs. a combi-
nation of these two approaches. We generally recommend that people try CBT initially,
if it is available, because the benefits tend to be longer lasting than those of medication.
In cases where CBT alone is not effective or is only partially effective, the addition of
medications can be considered.

CHOOSING AMONG MEDICATIONS

If you decide to try medications, there are two general classes of drugs that have been
found to be effective for social anxiety: antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications.
There is also evidence that beta-adrenergic blockers (also called “beta-blockers”) may
help with focused performance fears (for example, fears of public speaking), as well
as some preliminary research supporting the use of certain anticonvulsant medications
(these are drugs that are usually used to treat seizures). We will discuss each of these
approaches in this chapter, and we will also review what is known about the use of herbal
remedies for treating social anxiety.
When selecting among these medications, you and your doctor should take into
account the following factors:

```
UÊ Research findings on available medications. Treatment guidelines recently
published by the Canadian Psychiatric Association recommended antide-
pressant treatments as the first medications to try for social anxiety disor-
der, based on the most recent research (Swinson et al. 2006). In particular,
venlafaxine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline had been
investigated in the largest number of studies at the time the guidelines were
published. These medications are discussed later in this chapter.
```
```
UÊ Your particular social anxiety symptoms. For example, although people
with focused performance fears (like public speaking or performing music)
may benefit from treatment with beta-blockers, people with more general-
ized forms of social anxiety tend not to benefit from these medications.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Side effect profile of the medication. For instance, if you’re already strug-
gling with your weight, you might want to choose a medication for which
weight gain is not a likely side effect.
```
```
UÊ Previous response to medications. If you or a family member has previously
responded to a particular medication, that drug might be a good option
for you to try now. On the other hand, if there is a drug that didn’t work
for you in the past (despite a long enough trial at an adequate dosage), this
might be a time to try something new.
```
```
UÊ Additional psychological disorders that are present. For example, if you
are experiencing depression, it might make more sense to try an antidepres-
sant than an anti-anxiety drug. The antidepressant would likely lead to an
improvement in both problems.
```
```
UÊ Cost. Older medications tend to be less expensive than newer medications,
often because older drugs are available in generic forms.
```
```
UÊ Interactions with other medications and herbal remedies. If you are already
taking certain medications or herbal products, you should choose a drug
that will not interact with the products you are already taking.
```
```
UÊ Interactions with certain foods. Medications such as phenelzine can be dan-
gerous if taken with certain foods (those containing tyramine, such as aged
cheese and draft beer). Other medications may also interact with foods.
For example, grapefruit juice appears to decrease the metabolism of certain
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as sertraline and fluvoxamine),
increasing the likelihood that they will accumulate in the body.
```
```
UÊ Interactions with medical conditions. If you have a particular medical con-
dition (for example, high blood pressure), you should choose a drug that will
not worsen the symptoms of your illness.
```
```
UÊ Substance-use issues. If you enjoy drinking alcohol or if you use other
drugs, you should choose a medication that is unlikely to interact with these
substances.
```
```
UÊ Discontinuation issues. Medications that leave the body quickly (in other
words, those with a short half-life) are more likely to cause withdrawal
symptoms and are often harder to discontinue. Therefore, drugs with a
longer half-life are usually easier to discontinue. If you and/or your doctor
are concerned about your ability to discontinue a medication, this should be
factored into your decision regarding which drug to take. (The term half-life
refers to the time that it takes for half of the amount of drug in your body
```

```
Medications for Social Anxiety and Social Anxiety Disorder
```
```
to be metabolized or broken down. For example, a drug with a half-life of
twelve hours would be 50 percent broken down in twelve hours and 75
percent broken down after another twelve hours. Drugs with a longer half-
life are broken down more slowly, giving the body time to adjust to stopping
the drug).
```
STAGES IN MEDICATION TREATMENT

Treatment with medication involves the following five different stages:

1. The first stage is the _assessment_. During this phase, your doctor will ask you the
    necessary questions to help choose the best medication for your needs.
2. The second stage is _initiation of the drug_. In most cases, medications are started
    at relatively low dosages to give your body a chance to adapt gradually to
    the new drug.
3. The third stage is _dose escalation_. During this stage of treatment, the dosage
    is gradually increased until the individual’s symptoms start to improve. The
    goal of dose escalation is to find the lowest dosage that is effective for a
    particular person. Throughout the process, care is taken to minimize any
    side effects that may be present.
4. The fourth stage is called _maintenance_. During maintenance, the individual
    continues to take the medication for an extended period of time. For anti
    depressants, it is usually recommended that treatment continue for at
    least a year, minimizing the chances of symptoms returning following
    discontinuation.
5. The fifth and final stage of medication treatment is _discontinuation_. Some time
    after a person has improved on a medication, the individual may be encour-
    aged to decrease the amount of the medication to assess whether he or she
    is ready either to lower the dosage or to stop the medication completely. If a
    person is also receiving CBT, it may be helpful to have regular CBT sessions
    during the discontinuation phase. In some cases, your doctor may recom-
    mend that you continue to take a medication that is working for you.

TREATMENT WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS

Antidepressants are the most frequently recommended medications for social anxiety.
These drugs are called “antidepressants” because they were initially marketed for treating


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

depression. However, don’t be fooled by their name. These drugs are useful for a wide
range of psychological problems, including social anxiety disorder. In fact, they appear to
work for this problem regardless of whether an individual is depressed. There are several
classes of antidepressant medications that are thought to be useful for treating social
phobia. Each of these is described in this section. In addition, a table of recommended
dosages is included at the end of this section.
Note that we also indicate which of these drugs is officially approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although FDA approval typically indicates
that a medication is safe and effective when used properly, there are many medications
that are safe and effective for social anxiety that are not approved by the FDA or regula-
tory bodies in other countries. This is because it is very expensive and time consuming
for pharmaceutical companies to obtain official FDA indications for their products, and
they therefore tend to limit the number of problems for which they apply for approval.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

SSRIs are often the first choice for treating social phobia. In fact, the SSRI paroxetine
(Paxil) was the first drug to receive an FDA indication for treatment of social anxiety
disorder. Paroxetine is also available in a continuous release formula, marketed under
the name Paxil CR. Another SSRI that is FDA approved is sertraline (Zoloft). Although
only two SSRIs are officially approved for treating social anxiety disorder, there is no
evidence that either of these medications works any better or worse than most other
SSRIs for this problem. In practice, any of the SSRIs can be used to treat problems with
social anxiety. Other SSRIs that have been found to be effective for social anxiety disor-
der include fluvoxamine (Luvox), citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro in the
United States, Cipralex in Canada). Fluoxetine (Prozac) has been found to be effective
in some studies, but not others (Hedges et al. 2007; Swinson et al. 2006).
Although the side effects vary slightly across the SSRIs, some of the most common
ones include nausea, diarrhea, headache, sweating, increased anxiety, tremor, sexual dys-
function, weight gain, dry mouth, palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, twitching, constipa-
tion, increased appetite, fatigue, thirst, and insomnia. Don’t be discouraged by the long
list of side effects. Most people experience only a very small number of these, and some
individuals experience no side effects at all. Side effects are generally quite manageable.
They tend to be worse during the first few weeks of treatment and can be managed by
keeping the dosage low until the person becomes used to the medication. Certain side
effects (for example, medication-related weight gain and sexual dysfunction) tend not to
decrease over time, unless the drug is stopped or the dosage is decreased.
SSRIs typically take two to four weeks before they start working. They are believed
to work by altering serotonin levels in the brain. _Serotonin_ is an example of a _neurotransmitter_ ,
which is a chemical involved in the transmission of information from one brain cell to the


```

```
next. Serotonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of emotion and other aspects
of psychological functioning.
Most SSRIs are relatively easy to discontinue, although paroxetine is more likely
than the others to cause withdrawal symptoms during discontinuation because it is
metabolized more quickly by the body. Therefore, paroxetine should be stopped more
gradually than the other SSRIs. Common withdrawal symptoms during discontinuation
of paroxetine include sleep disturbances, agitation, tremor, anxiety, nausea, diarrhea, dry
mouth, vomiting, sexual disturbances, and sweating.

```
Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake
Inhibitors (SNRIs)
```
Venlafaxine XR (Effexor XR) is currently the only available SNRI that has been
found in large studies to be effective for treating social anxiety disorder—in fact, it is
approved by the FDA for this purpose (the “XR” stands for “extended release”). Unlike
the SSRIs, venlafaxine acts both on the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmitter
systems, both of which appear to be related to problems with anxiety and depression.
A number of well-controlled studies suggest that venlafaxine is useful for treating social
phobia (Swinson et al. 2006), although, like the SSRIs, it takes several weeks to have
an effect. The most commonly reported side effects of venlafaxine include sweating,
nausea, constipation, loss of appetite, vomiting, sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, ner-
vousness, increased anxiety, and sexual disturbances. When discontinued too quickly,
the most common withdrawal symptoms include: sleep disturbances, dizziness, nervous-
ness, dry mouth, anxiety, nausea, headache, sweating, and sexual problems. Duloxetine
(Cymbalta) is another recently introduced SNRI that has been shown to be useful for
depression and some forms of anxiety. However, with the exception of published case
studies (Crippa et al. 2007), this drug has not yet been studied for social anxiety, and it
is too early to recommend it for this problem.

```
Noradrenergic/Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants
(NaSSAs)
```
Currently, the only NaSSA available is a drug called mirtazapine (Remeron). Like
the SNRIs, mirtazapine works by affecting levels of both norepinephrine and sero-
tonin. This drug is newer than the other antidepressants discussed so far. Nevertheless,
some initial studies suggest that mirtazapine is an effective treatment for social anxiety
disorder (Muehlbacher et al. 2005; Van Veen, Van Vliet, and Westenberg 2002). The
most common side effects of mirtazapine include sleepiness, weight gain, dry mouth,
constipation, and blurred vision.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

MAOIs affect three neurotransmitter systems in the brain: serotonin, norepineph-
rine, and dopamine. The most studied MAOI for treating social phobia is phenelzine
(Nardil). This drug has consistently been found to alleviate the symptoms of social
phobia (Swinson et al. 2006). Like the other antidepressants, phenelzine takes several
weeks to have a therapeutic effect.
Despite their effectiveness, MAOIs are rarely used in clinical practice because of
necessary dietary restrictions and because the side effects tend to be worse than those
from other medications. When taking MAOIs, you must avoid foods containing a sub-
stance called tyramine. These include aged cheeses, meat extracts, overripe bananas,
sausage, tofu, soy sauce, draft beer, and many other foods. MAOIs are also dangerous
when combined with certain other medications, including SSRIs. The most commonly
reported side effects of MAOIs include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, sleep distur-
bances, fatigue, weakness, tremors, twitching, constipation, dry mouth, weight gain, low
blood pressure, and sexual disturbances.

Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase (RIMAs)

Reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase are a type of MAOI that tend to have
fewer side effects than traditional MAOIs. In addition, they are less likely than traditional
MAOIs to interact with other medications and with foods containing tyramine. The only
RIMA that is available is moclobemide (Manerix in Canada, Aurorix in several other
countries), though this drug is not currently marketed in the United States. Findings
from studies on moclobemide for social anxiety disorder have been mixed. Early studies
found that this medication was helpful for treating social anxiety, whereas more recent
studies have found only modest effects. In some studies, moclobemide was no better
than placebo (Swinson et al. 2006).
The most commonly reported side effects for people taking moclobemide include
fatigue, constipation, low blood pressure, decreased sex drive, dry mouth, difficulties
ejaculating, insomnia, vertigo, and headache. Like the other antidepressants, moclobemide
takes several weeks to have a therapeutic effect.

TREATMENT WITH ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATIONS

The most frequently prescribed anti-anxiety medications are the benzodiazepines. These
are sedatives that include drugs such as clonazepam (Klonapin in the USA; Rivotril
in Canada), alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan). To date,
only clonazepam and alprazolam have been investigated in controlled studies for the
treatment of social anxiety disorder (Swinson et al. 2006). Although neither is officially
approved by the FDA for treating social anxiety, both of these medications have been
found to be useful for this problem. The typical starting dose for alprazolam and clon-
azepam is .5 mg per day, with a maximum daily dose of 1.5 to 3 mg for alprazolam and
4 mg for clonazepam (Swinson et al. 2006).
When taken on a regular basis, these medications tend to be effective for treat-
ing social anxiety. The most common side effects include drowsiness, lightheadedness,
depression, headache, confusion, dizziness, unsteadiness, insomnia, and nervousness.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

These drugs may affect a person’s ability to drive safely and they tend to interact
strongly with alcohol. In addition, they should be used with caution by older people
because higher dosages have been associated with a greater likelihood of falling.
There are several advantages to taking benzodiazepines compared with antidepres-
sant medications. First, they work very quickly (within a half hour) and therefore can
be used on an “as needed” basis to deal with particularly stressful situations. They also
may be used during the first few weeks of antidepressant treatment, while the indi-
vidual waits for the antidepressant to take effect. In addition, the side effect profile of
benzodiazepines is quite different from that of antidepressants, and these drugs may be
more easily tolerated by some people.
Despite these benefits, benzodiazepines have fallen out of favor in recent years,
mostly because they can be difficult to discontinue. Stopping these drugs can cause
temporary (but sometimes intense) feelings of anxiety, arousal, and insomnia. In rare
cases, abrupt discontinuation can cause seizures. Given that discontinuation from these
medications can cause intense anxiety, it is not surprising that some individuals have
difficulty stopping these drugs. The symptoms of withdrawal can be minimized by dis-
continuing these drugs very gradually. Benzodiazepines are a potentially effective option
for treating social anxiety, particularly over brief periods. However, they are typically
not recommended as a first-line treatment (Swinson et al. 2006).

TREATMENT WITH BETA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKERS

Beta-blockers are normally used for treating high blood pressure. In addition, they are
effective for decreasing some of the physical symptoms of fear such as palpitations and
shakiness. A number of early studies suggest that beta-blockers are useful for managing
intense fear in certain performance situations (Hartley et al. 1983; James, Burgoyne, and
Savage 1983). In particular, they are often used by actors, musicians, and other perform-
ers to manage stage fright. However, beta-blockers are ineffective for treating more
generalized forms of social anxiety and shyness. The most commonly used beta-blocker
for treating performance fears is propanolol (Inderal). This medication is normally taken
in a single dose of 5 to 10 mg, about twenty to thirty minutes before a performance.

ANTICONVULSANTS

Anticonvulsants are used to treat seizures, as well as pain, anxiety, and certain mood
problems. Recently, there have been a number of preliminary studies finding that certain
anticonvulsants such as gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), and topiramate
(Topamax) may be useful for treating social anxiety disorder (Swinson et al. 2006). At
this point, however, it is too soon to recommend these treatments for social anxiety.
Additional research is needed.

NATURAL AND HERBAL REMEDIES FOR

SOCIAL ANXIETY

In recent years, herbal preparations have become popular for treating a wide range of
health problems. For the treatment of anxiety and related problems, commonly used
herbal preparations include St.-John’s-wort, kava kava, inositol, Rescue Remedy, and
various other products. Generally, there have been very few studies on these products
in people with anxiety-based problems, and we are aware of only one study that has
specifically tested the effects of an herbal remedy for treating social anxiety disorder
(Kobak et al. 2005). In this study, 600 to 1800 mg per day of St.-John’s-wort (also known
as hypericum) was compared to an inactive placebo in forty people with social anxiety
disorder. No differences were found in the effectiveness of St.-John’s-wort vs. placebo,
despite the fact that some studies have found St.-John’s-wort to be an effective treatment
for depression.
In addition to the lack of studies on the _effectiveness_ of herbal treatments, very little is
known about the _safety_ of many of these remedies or the extent to which they interact
with conventional medications. Be sure to tell your doctor if you are taking any herbal
products, just in case there are any known interactions with medications you may also
be taking.
Although little is known about the effects of herbal treatments on social anxiety,
there are a few studies on the use of herbal products for other anxiety problems (Connor
and Vaishnavi, in press). Still, more studies are currently under way. In the coming years,
additional information regarding the safety, interactions, and effectiveness of these
treatments will be available.

COMBINING MEDICATIONS

Your doctor may recommend combining several medications for treating your social
anxiety. In most cases, there is very little research on the benefits of combining differ-
ent medications. However, one combination that has been studied for the treatment of
anxiety is the combination of an antidepressant (for example, paroxetine) with a benzodi-
azepine (for example, clonazepam). Ideally, both drugs are started at the same time. The
benzodiazepine helps to keep the anxiety under control during the first few weeks while
the person waits for the antidepressant to start working. Then, once the antidepressant
kicks in, the benzodiazepine is discontinued gradually.
A limited number of studies have investigated whether it is useful to combine an
SSRI with a benzodiazepine. Whereas some studies of anxiety problems other than
social phobia suggest that this combination is useful for reducing anxiety symptoms
more quickly than an SSRI alone (Pollack et al. 2003), a study of people suffering from
social phobia did not find any added benefit of combining medications on the rate of
recovery (Seedat and Stein 2004).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

COMBINING MEDICATION WITH

PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS

Studies comparing medications to CBT have generally found both approaches to be very
effective for reducing anxiety. In addition, a number of researchers have begun to study
the benefits of combining CBT and medications (Antony and Rowa 2008). Overall, there
do not appear to be any consistent benefits of combining these treatments. That is,
medication, CBT, and a combination of these approaches all tend to be about equally
effective on average, based on the available evidence (for instance, Davidson et al. 2004).
However, that doesn’t mean that one approach or another is not likely to be more effec-
tive for any one person (including you). In other words, it is often the case that some
people do best with CBT, some do best with medication, and some do best with a com-
bined treatment. If you decide to try combining CBT with medication, it is helpful if
both treatments are delivered by the same person, or if the professionals providing you
with CBT and medication are in contact with one another. Treatment is most likely to
be helpful when multiple treatments are delivered in a coordinated fashion.

COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT MEDICATION

**Question:** Is taking medication a sign of weakness?

**Answer:** Taking medication for social phobia is no more a sign of weakness than
taking medication for any other problem, such as physical illnesses like
high blood pressure.

**Question:** What level of improvement can I expect?

**Answer:** A small percentage of people obtain no benefit at all from medications
for social phobia. Another small group of people obtain almost com-
plete improvement. However, most people with social phobia experi-
ence moderate improvements with medications. They tend to feel less
anxious overall and are more comfortable in a broader range of situa-
tions. However, there may still be areas in which the social anxiety is a
problem for them.

**Question:** Are medications for social anxiety dangerous?

**Answer:** When taken as prescribed, medications for social phobia are gener-
ally safe. When side effects cause problems, as a rule they are easy to
manage by decreasing the dosage or switching to a different drug.


```
Medications for Social Anxiety and Social Anxiety Disorder
```
**Question:** Is it dangerous for me to stop taking my medication?

**Answer:** Medications should always be stopped gradually and in close consul-
tation with your doctor. If done properly, discontinuation is generally
safe.

**Question:** What happens if my medication doesn’t work for me?

**Answer:** If your medication doesn’t work, it is important to first make sure you
have been taking it for a long enough time and at an adequate dose. If
your medication still is not effective despite an appropriate duration and
dosage, you may still benefit from trying a different medication or from
receiving CBT.

**Question:** How long should I try a medication before assuming that it isn’t going
to work?

**Answer:** Most antidepressants will start to have an effect within four to six weeks,
if not earlier. If you haven’t experienced any benefit after eight weeks
at a high enough dosage, it may be worth discussing the possibility of
trying a different treatment with your doctor.

**Question:** If I go off my medication and my anxiety returns, am I likely to benefit
again if I resume taking the same medication?

**Answer:** Often, when a previously effective medication is tried for a second time
(following a break), it will work again. However, sometimes a particular
medication is less effective the second time, in which case a different
medication may be prescribed.

In summary, medications can be an effective method of managing severe social
anxiety. Certain anti-anxiety medications (for example, clonazepam) and a number of
different antidepressants (for instance, paroxetine, venlafaxine) have consistently been
shown to help reduce symptoms of social anxiety. If you decide that you would like to
try medication, a first step is to contact your family doctor or psychiatrist. Your doctor
will be able to recommend a specific medication that is likely to work for you.



CHAPTER 6

### Changing Your Anxious

### Thoughts and Expectations

The word _cognition_ refers to the ways in which we process information, including experi-
ences such as thought, perception, interpretation, attention, memory, and knowledge.
The word _cognitive_ is simply the adjectival form of the term cognition. For example,
cognitive science is the science concerned with the ways in which we think. _Cognitive
therapy_ is a type of psychotherapy that is designed to alter negative and unrealistic beliefs,
thoughts, and interpretations.
This chapter provides an overview of strategies that have been shown to be useful for
decreasing social anxiety by changing negative or unrealistic patterns of thinking. Many
of the cognitive techniques and principles discussed in this book have been presented
and expanded upon elsewhere by authors such as Aaron T. Beck (Beck, Emery, and
Greenberg 1985), David Burns (1999), David M. Clark (Clark and Wells 1995), Richard
Heimberg (Heimberg and Becker 2002), Christine Padesky (Greenberger and Padesky
1995), and others. Over the years, strategies similar to those discussed in this chapter
have been adopted by the majority of therapists who practice cognitive therapy.

THE ORIGINS OF COGNITIVE THERAPY

Cognitive therapy was proposed in the 1960s and 1970s as an alternative to traditional
_psychodynamic psychotherapies_ , which were the most prevalent forms of therapy at the time.
The original (and most influential), form of psychodynamic psychotherapy is _psychoanaly-
sis_ , which Sigmund Freud developed in the early 1900s. Psychodynamic psychotherapies,


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

including psychoanalysis, are concerned with helping individuals understand deep-rooted
unconscious conflicts that are presumed to cause or contribute to their psychological
problems. For example, Freud proposed that depression can occur as a response to
having unconscious aggressive thoughts or feelings toward a loved one. Because such
feelings are viewed as unacceptable by the individual, he or she is very motivated to
keep such thoughts and feelings outside of conscious awareness. According to Freud,
rather than allowing the aggressive thoughts to surface, the individual may turn those
angry feelings inward, leading to feelings of self-hatred and worthlessness, which are
often features of depression.
There are many newer forms of psychodynamic therapy (most psychodynamic psy-
chotherapists no longer accept all of Freud’s ideas), though the focus of these treatments
often remains on recounting early childhood experiences, interpreting unconscious expe-
rience (such as dreams), and helping individuals to understand the unconscious motiva-
tions for their behavior. Although psychodynamic psychotherapies remain popular, they
have gradually lost ground to other forms of therapy, including cognitive and behavioral
therapies. Some reasons for the decline of psychodynamic psychotherapies include the
relative lack of research supporting many of the underlying theoretical assumptions, as
well as a lack of research demonstrating the effectiveness of this form of treatment for
many specific problems, including social anxiety.
Despite these criticisms, psychoanalysis and the psychodynamic psychotherapies
have made considerable contributions to the understanding and treatment of psycho-
logical problems. For example, these were the first treatments based on the assumption
that simply talking to another person can lead to psychological changes. In addition,
these treatments highlighted the importance of nonconscious information processing.
Although there is little evidence to prove the existence of many of the unconscious
motivations proposed by Freud, there is evidence that suggests people are frequently
unaware of the perceptions and interpretations that contribute to their understanding
of their environment. Finally, although many specific aspects of his theory were prob-
ably misguided, Freud highlighted the importance of early experience in determining
psychological functioning later in life.

The Birth of Cognitive Therapy

In the 1960s and 1970s, a number of psychologists and psychiatrists, disenchanted
with psychodynamic psychotherapies, began to explore other ways of helping their
patients and clients. Working independently, psychiatrist Aaron Beck (1963; 1964; 1967;
1976) and psychologists Albert Ellis (1962; 1989) and Donald Meichenbaum (1977) each
developed new forms of therapy based on the premise that people’s difficulties with
depression, anxiety, anger, and related problems stem from the ways in which they think
about themselves, their environment, and the future.
For example, fear was assumed to stem from a belief that a particular situation was
threatening or dangerous. Beck, Ellis, and Meichenbaum each developed treatments


```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
designed to help individuals recognize how their beliefs and assumptions contribute to
their negative emotions, and to overcome psychological suffering by changing these neg-
ative thoughts. Ellis called his form of treatment _rational emotive therapy_ and later renamed
it _rational emotive behavior therapy_ (REBT, 1993). Meichenbaum referred to his form of treat-
ment as cognitive-behavior modification (CBM). It was Aaron Beck, however, who first
used the term _cognitive therapy_ to describe his treatment. Each of these three new treat-
ments was developed at about the same time, and they were quite similar with respect
to their underlying assumptions and some of the treatment strategies used.
Over the years, Beck’s form of treatment has become more popular and prominent
than either Ellis’s or Meichenbaum’s approaches. Furthermore, Beck’s cognitive therapy
has been subjected to more rigorous study than either REBT or CBM for the treatment
of social anxiety. Therefore, the methods discussed in this chapter are based on those
proposed by Beck and his collaborators, as well as others who adapted and expanded
upon Beck’s methods for treating social anxiety and related problems.

ASSUMPTIONS OF COGNITIVE THERAPY

FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY

Here are some of the basic assumptions of cognitive therapy, particularly as related to
the treatment of shyness, social anxiety, and performance fears.

1. Negative emotions are caused by negative interpretations and beliefs. People
    who interpret a given situation in different ways are likely to experience dif-
    ferent emotions. For example, imagine that a friend of yours has cancelled
    a dinner date at the last minute without providing a reason. Below is a list
    of possible emotional reactions you might have depending on your beliefs
    and interpretations.

```
Situation: Friend cancels dinner date at the last minute and gives no reason
```
```
Interpretation Emotion
```
```
“My friend has been hurt or is ill.” Anxiety or worry
```
```
“My friend isn’t treating me with the respect I deserve.” Anger
```
```
“My friend doesn’t care about me.” Sadness
“Thank goodness the dinner has been cancelled; I am
always so nervous when I have to eat with others.”
```
```
Relief
```
```
“I guess something else came up. Everyone changes
plans from time to time, including me.”
```
```
Neutral
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

2. Anxiety and fear result when a person interprets a situation as threatening
    or dangerous. Although fearful predictions and interpretations are sometimes
    accurate, they are often exaggerated or inaccurate. Chapter 1 provided a list of
    thoughts and assumptions that can contribute to social anxiety. These include
    beliefs about one’s performance (such as, “People will think that I am an idiot”),
    as well as beliefs about the anxiety itself (for instance, “It’s important for me
    not to appear anxious in front of other people”). Beliefs such as these help to
    maintain a person’s anxiety in social and performance situations.
3. You are the expert regarding your own thoughts and feelings. Unlike some
    other forms of therapy, which assume that the therapist is the expert, cogni-
    tive therapy assumes that the patient and therapist have unique areas of exper-
    tise, and the best way to work on a problem is to take advantage of the skills
    and expertise that each brings to the therapeutic situation. The therapist is
    assumed to be an expert on the principles and methods of cognitive therapy.
    The patient is assumed to be an expert regarding his or her own experi-
    ences, assumptions, and beliefs. In most cases, the therapist and patient decide
    together whether a particular belief is exaggerated or unrealistic, and together
    they generate strategies for changing negative patterns of thinking.
4. The goal of cognitive therapy is to be able to think more _realistically_ rather
    than simply to think _positively_. There are occasions where your anxious beliefs
    are realistic and are quite consistent with the actual threat in a given situa-
    tion. In these cases, anxiety may be a good thing because it helps you stay
    on guard and protect yourself from possible danger. For instance, being a bit
    nervous while interacting with an authority figure (for example, your boss, a
    police officer) may protect you from seeming overly confident, demanding,
    or aggressive. Cognitive therapy focuses on situations where your beliefs,
    predictions, and interpretations are exaggerated when compared with the
    actual level of danger in the situation.
5. People naturally tend to seek out and pay attention to information that con-
    firms their beliefs. In the case of social anxiety, people pay more atten-
    tion and give more weight to evidence that others are judging them nega-
    tively (such as a history of being teased in high school) than to evidence
    that contradicts the anxious beliefs (for instance, a history of very positive
    performance appraisals at work). Cognitive therapy aims to help people to
    consider all the evidence before making any assumptions.

TYPES OF ANXIOUS THINKING

Anxious thinking begins and persists when people make incorrect assumptions about
what is likely to happen in a given situation, about the quality of their own performance,


```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
and about what other people are thinking of them. This section includes descriptions
of some of the most common styles of thinking that often seem to play a role in social
and performance anxiety. Note that there are additional examples of negative and exag-
gerated thinking that other authors have highlighted (see, for example, Burns 1999) that
we have chosen not to include in this section. In most cases, these were omitted either
because they were not especially relevant to social anxiety or because they were very
similar and overlapped considerably with those examples that we have included. In fact,
even the various thinking styles on this list overlap to some extent. As you may notice, a
particular anxious thought (something like, “Other people will think that I am boring”)
may easily fit into more than one category (probability overestimation, mind reading).

Probability Overestimations

A _probability overestimation_ is a prediction that a person believes is likely to come true,
even though the actual likelihood is relatively low. For example, someone who is fearful of
giving presentations might predict that the next presentation is likely to go poorly, even
though her presentations usually go well. Similarly, a person who is nervous about dating
might assume that other people will find him unattractive, even though many people
have found him to be attractive in the past. If your thoughts are similar to those listed
below, you may have a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of negative events.

```
Examples of Probability Overestimations
```
```
UÊ I will be overwhelmed with panic.
```
```
UÊ Everyone at the party will think I’m stupid.
```
```
UÊ My presentation will be a disaster.
```
```
UÊ I will never be in an intimate relationship again.
```
```
UÊ I will have nothing to say if I phone my cousin.
```
```
UÊ I will lose my job if I make a mistake.
```
```
UÊ If I go out, everyone will stare at me.
```
Can you think of recent instances when you assumed that things were going to work
out badly, without any evidence for that assumption? If so, list your own examples of
probability overestimations below:


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Mind Reading

_Mind reading_ is actually just an example of a probability overestimation. It involves
making negative assumptions about what other people are thinking, particularly what
they might be thinking about you. If social anxiety is a problem for you, it is likely
that you assume that others think negatively about you. Although it is true that people
sometimes make negative judgments about others, the chances are that this occurs much
less often than you think. In many cases, your assumptions about what others are think-
ing are probably exaggerated or even completely untrue. Each of the following kinds of
thoughts represents mind reading:

```
Examples of Mind Reading
```
```
UÊ People find me boring.
```
```
UÊ My boss will think I’m an idiot if he sees my hands shaking.
```
```
UÊ When people look at me, they are thinking I am strange or weird.
```
```
UÊ Most people see anxiety as a sign of weakness.
```
```
UÊ My friends think I am awkward or stupid when I lose my train of thought.
```
```
UÊ People always know when I am feeling anxious.
```
Can you think of recent examples of times when you have made assumptions about
what other people are thinking about you? If so, list your own examples of mind reading
below:

Personalization

_Personalization_ is the tendency to take more responsibility for a negative situation than
you should, rather than acknowledging all of the different factors that may have contrib-
uted to the situation. Here are some examples of personalization, followed by examples
of other factors that in reality may have contributed to the situation.

uted to the situation include (1) the other person
couldn’t think of anything to talk about, (2) I had
nothing in common with the other guest, even
though neither of us is actually boring, and (3) it
is normal for many conversations at parties to end
fairly quickly. Nobody was at fault.
The fact that my boss got
angry at me for making a
mistake is proof that I am
incompetent.
```
```
In reality, other factors that may have contrib-
uted to the situation include (1) my boss is always
getting angry at people, so I shouldn’t feel singled
out, (2) my boss’s expectations are too high (I
know that not every boss in the world would have
yelled at me for making a mistake; part of why my
boss became angry had to do with his own
expectations, rather than me making a mistake),
and (3) there are many reasons why people make
mistakes besides incompetence.
People were falling asleep
during my presentation,
proving once again that I am a
really boring speaker.
```
```
In reality, other factors that may have contributed
to the situation include (1) the topic was somewhat
dry and would have been difficult for any speaker
to make exciting, (2) the presentation was late in
the day, and the audience was feeling tired, and (3)
it is normal for some people to feel bored at a talk;
other people probably found it interesting.
I was in an elevator and a
woman was looking at me. She
was probably thinking that I
looked strange.
```
```
In reality, other factors that may have contributed
to the situation include (1) she was staring at me
because she liked the way I look or what I was
wearing, (2) she was looking in my direction but
wasn’t really looking at me (maybe she was staring
into space or daydreaming), and (3) she noticed
me but was thinking of other things.

“Should” Statements

_“Should” statements_ are incorrect or exaggerated assumptions about the way things _ought_
to be. Statements that include words like “always,” “never,” “should,” and “must” are
often “should” statements. Sometimes, the tendency to use words such as these is a sign
of having overly rigid and perfectionistic expectations for yourself or for others. Here
are some examples:

```
Examples of “Should” Statements
```
```
UÊ I should never feel nervous around other people.
```
```
UÊ I must never let my anxiety show.
```
```
UÊ I should never make mistakes.
```
```
UÊ I must never inconvenience other people.
```
```
UÊ Others should never think badly about me.
```
```
UÊ I ought never to do anything to draw attention to myself.
```
```
UÊ Others must never tease me or laugh at something that I have done.
```
```
UÊ I should always be interesting and entertaining to others.
```
```
UÊ I must do things perfectly so everything is just right.
```
In the space below, list examples from your own life of unreasonable expectations
(“shoulds”) that you hold for yourself or others:

Catastrophic Thinking

_Catastrophic thinking_ (also known as _catastrophizing_ ) is the tendency to assume that if a
negative event were to occur, it would be absolutely terrible and unmanageable. From
time to time, we all make mistakes, offend others, or look foolish. One difference
between people who are socially anxious and those who are not particularly anxious is
how they deal with these unfortunate social events. People who have very little social
anxiety are often able to say to themselves, “Who cares what this person thinks? I have
the right to make a mistake from time to time.” Or, “I feel sorry that I upset that person,


```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
but everyone puts their foot in it at times.” In contrast, people who feel anxious around
others are more likely to think, “It would be a disaster to have others think badly of me.”
Below are more examples of catastrophic thinking:

```
Examples of Catastrophic Thinking
```
```
UÊ It would be terrible if my anxiety showed during my presentation.
```
```
UÊ I would not be able to handle making a fool of myself.
```
```
UÊ It would be terrible to be unable to think of things to say during my date
on Saturday night.
```
```
UÊ If someone shows signs of not liking me, it feels like the end of the world.
```
```
UÊ It would be terrible to lose my train of thought during a presentation.
```
```
UÊ It would be a disaster if I blushed while answering a question in class.
```
In the space below, list examples of times when you have catastrophized or exaggerated
how bad a particular outcome would be if it actually were to occur:

All-or-Nothing Thinking

_All-or-nothing thinking_ (also called _black-and-white thinking_ ) is the tendency to judge any
performance that falls short of perfection as being completely unacceptable. People who
engage in this style of thinking tend to categorize their behavior as being either perfect
or awful, without acknowledging all of the possibilities that lie between these two
extremes. As with “should” statements, all-or-nothing thinking is associated with exces-
sive perfectionism and a tendency to hold unrealistic standards. Following are several
examples of all-or-nothing thinking:

```
Examples of All-or-Nothing Thinking
```
```
UÊ If I lose my train of thought even once, I will blow the entire presentation.
```
```
UÊ Even one person thinking I look nervous is too many.
```
```
UÊ If I don’t get an A on my exam, my teacher will think I am stupid.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ It is unacceptable if my boss makes any negative comments or suggests even
one area for improvement during my annual performance review.
```
```
UÊ Showing any signs of anxiety is almost as bad as falling completely apart.
```
In the space below, list examples of the times when you engaged in all-or-nothing
thinking:

Selective Attention and Memory

_Selective attention_ is the tendency to pay more attention to certain types of information
than to other types. _Selective memory_ is the tendency to remember certain types of informa-
tion more easily than other types. As discussed earlier, people are more likely to attend
to and remember information that is consistent with their beliefs. Therefore, people with
social anxiety are more likely than others to remember times when they were criticized
or teased by another person or when they performed poorly in a social situation. When
performing in social situations or interacting with others, individuals with social phobia
are more likely to notice people who appear to be bored or disapproving. Some other
examples of selective memory and attention are provided below:

```
Examples of Selective Attention and Memory
```
```
UÊ Ignoring positive feedback from a teacher or boss (in other words, discount-
ing positive feedback as if it doesn’t matter), yet taking negative feedback
very seriously (for example, letting negative feedback ruin your day)
```
```
UÊ Focusing on the one low grade on your report card and ignoring all the
high grades
```
```
UÊ Remembering being teased in high school, while forgetting about the good
times spent with friends after school
```
```
UÊ Focusing on audience members who seem bored during your presentation
and ignoring those in the crowd who appear to be enjoying your talk
```
```
UÊ Focusing on the moment during a conversation when you stumbled over
your words and lost your train of thought, while ignoring the fact that the
rest of the conversation was fairly smooth
```

```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
Can you think of ways in which you selectively pay attention to events or information
that confirm your anxious beliefs and selectively ignore information that is inconsistent
with those beliefs? In the space below, list examples of times when you have engaged in
selective attention or memory:

Negative Core Beliefs

In addition to paying attention to your negative thinking in particular situations that
trigger your anxiety, it may also be useful to become more aware of any deeper, more
central, and long-standing assumptions that contribute to your feelings of anxiety. These
assumptions are called _core beliefs_ and they can include negative assumptions that people
hold about themselves (for example, “I am incompetent”), other people (for instance,
“Other people cannot be trusted”), and the world (such as, “The world is a dangerous
place”). The more strongly held these core beliefs are, the more difficult they may be
to change.
One technique for uncovering core beliefs involves continually asking about the
meaning of each fearful belief you have until the core beliefs underlying your anxious
interpretations are revealed. This process is illustrated in the following conversation
between Liam and his therapist:

_Liam:_ I am terrified to ask my coworker Cindy out on a date.

_Therapist:_ What are you afraid might happen if you ask her out?

_Liam:_ Mostly, I’m afraid she will say no.

_Therapist:_ Why would that be a problem?

_Liam:_ If she rejects me, it will probably mean that she doesn’t find me attractive.

_Therapist:_ What would be so bad about that?

_Liam:_ It will confirm my own belief that I am unattractive.

_Therapist :_ What if that’s true?

_Liam:_ Well, if I really am unattractive, that means nobody will ever think I’m
attractive or want to date me. It would mean that I am unlovable.

_Therapist:_ What would be bad about being unlovable?


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

_Liam:_ If I am unlovable, I am bound to be alone forever.

_Therapist:_ So, to summarize, you seem to be saying that (1) if another person turns
down your invitation for a date, it means that she finds you unattractive, (2)
if another person finds you unattractive, then everyone will find you unat-
tractive, (3) being turned down for a date means that you are unlovable and
destined to be alone forever. Do you think of yourself as unlovable?

_Liam:_ I think I do. Part of me knows it isn’t true, but much of the time I just can’t
shake that belief.

HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR ANXIOUS THOUGHTS

AND PREDICTIONS

In chapter 3, we discussed strategies for identifying your anxious thoughts. We suggest
that you review the relevant passages in chapter 3 on identifying anxious thoughts before
trying to use the techniques discussed in the remainder of this chapter. There is no point
trying to change your anxious beliefs unless you are clear about the content of these
beliefs. In addition to reviewing the anxious thoughts recorded in chapter 3, identify-
ing your anxious beliefs, predictions, and assumptions should be an ongoing process.
Whenever you find yourself in an anxiety-provoking situation, try to identify the specific
thoughts and beliefs that contribute to your discomfort. In most cases, you can identify
your anxious predictions and assumptions by asking yourself a series of questions such
as the following:

```
UÊ What am I afraid will happen in this situation?
```
```
UÊ What do I fear that the other person will think about me?
```
```
UÊ What will happen if my anxious thoughts are true?
```
Sometimes it may be difficult to pinpoint your fearful thoughts. Chances are that
social anxiety has been a part of your life for so long that your negative thoughts are
well-rehearsed, very quick, and almost automatic (like habits). Also, the fact that you
probably avoid the situations you fear makes it that much more difficult to remember
exactly what thoughts tend to occur when you are actually in the situation.
If you have difficulty identifying your anxious beliefs, we suggest that you try to
engage with the situations you fear and attempt to identify your assumptions and predic-
tions while you are still in the situation. With practice, it should get easier to recognize
your anxious beliefs. In fact, even if you are unable to identify the specific thoughts that
contribute to your anxiety, practicing being in the situation will likely lead to a decrease
in your fear, as discussed in chapters 7 and 8.

STRATEGIES FOR CHANGING ANXIOUS THINKING

This section provides an overview of seven different techniques for changing the beliefs
and predictions that contribute to your social anxiety. These include (1) examining the
evidence for your beliefs, (2) challenging catastrophic thinking, (3) remembering your
strengths, (4) seeing yourself as others do, (5) examining the costs and benefits of your
thoughts, (6) creating rational coping statements, and (7) conducting behavioral experi-
ments. Along with a description of each strategy, we include exercises to provide oppor-
tunities to try each technique. Near the end of the chapter, we offer some suggestions
for tying together all the pieces and for integrating the cognitive therapy techniques into
your larger treatment plan.

Examining the Evidence

The fact that you are anxious about being judged by others in a particular situation
doesn’t mean that your fearful predictions and thoughts are true. In fact, what we assume
others are thinking is often completely different than what other people actually think
of us. How many times have you heard someone say, “My hair looks awful” or “I am
such a loser” and thought to yourself that the individual was just fine? If you are consis-
tently assuming you’re inferior in the eyes of others, you are probably exaggerating or
misinterpreting other people’s reactions to your appearance, behavior, or performance.
The first step toward changing your thoughts is to recognize that your beliefs are
not facts. Rather than assuming that your beliefs are true, it is important to treat your
anxious thoughts as guesses or hypotheses. By examining the evidence, you will be able
to assess the extent to which your beliefs are true. Remember, your natural tendency
may be to seek out only information that confirms your negative beliefs about yourself.
Examining the evidence involves trying to achieve a more balanced view by looking at all
the evidence, especially information that contradicts or disproves your anxious thoughts
and predictions.
In order to examine the evidence for your beliefs, we recommend you get into the
habit of asking yourself questions such as the following:

```
UÊ How do I know for sure that my prediction will come true?
```
```
UÊ What does my past experience tell me about the likelihood of my thoughts
coming true?
```
```
UÊ Have there been times when I have experienced anxious thoughts that
didn’t come true?
```
```
UÊ Are there facts or statistics that can help me to decide whether my predic-
tion is likely to come true?
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Are there other possible interpretations for this situation?
```
```
UÊ How might another person interpret this situation?
```
You may find it useful to type these questions on a small index card and carry that
card as a reminder in your pocket or wallet. Essentially, examining the evidence involves
four basic steps: identifying your anxious beliefs, generating alternative beliefs, weigh-
ing the evidence supporting and contradicting your beliefs, and choosing more realistic
beliefs. Asking questions similar to those listed above will help you to identify alternative
beliefs and to evaluate the evidence concerning your anxious and alternative beliefs. An
illustration of how to use this strategy to combat a fear of shaking during a presentation
appears below:

```
Steps for Examining the Evidence
```
1. Identify the Anxious Thought
    UÊ The audience will think I am incompetent if they see my hands shaking
       during my talk.
2. Generate Alternative Beliefs
    UÊ Nobody will notice my shaking.
    UÊ Only a small number of people will notice my shaking.
    UÊ People who notice my shaking will think I am tired or that I have had
       too much coffee.
    UÊ People who notice my shaking will think I am feeling a bit anxious.
    UÊ It is normal to shake sometimes, so people will think nothing of it if they
       notice my shaky hands.
3. Examine the Evidence
    _Evidence Supporting Your Anxious Belief_
    UÊ I believe that my shaking is very extreme.
    UÊ A few people have commented on my shaky hands over the years.
    UÊ I tend to notice when other people shake.

```
Evidence Supporting Your Alternative Beliefs
UÊ I know others with shaky hands, and people don’t seem to think they
are incompetent.
UÊ When I notice other people shaking, I don’t think they are incompetent.
UÊ Often people seem not to have noticed me shaking when I asked them
if it was noticeable.
```

```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
```
UÊ When people have noticed my shaking, they haven’t tended to treat me
differently.
UÊ The people in the audience know me well. I can’t imagine that their
opinions of me would change dramatically based on whether my hands
shook during a single presentation.
```
4. Choose a More Realistic Belief
    UÊ Some people may notice my shaky hands, but it’s unlikely that they will
       think I’m incompetent.

The following form can be used as you begin to work on examining the evidence
supporting and contradicting your anxious beliefs. You may want to make copies of this
form so that you can continue to use it whenever you encounter a feared situation.

Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
To further illustrate the process of examining the evidence, here is an example of a
discussion between Stephen and his therapist demonstrating how to first identify anxious
beliefs and then challenge those beliefs based on your past experiences.

_Therapist:_ What are you afraid will happen if you attend your company picnic next
week?

_Stephen:_ I am nervous that I won’t be able to come up with anything to say to anyone.
Everyone else will be talking about their children. I’m not in a relationship,
and I have no kids, so I will have nothing in common with any of them.

_Therapist:_ How sure are you that you will have nothing to say?

_Stephen:_ Probably about 90 percent.

_Therapist:_ What that means is that nine out of ten times that you attend an event such
as this one, you have nothing to say. Is this really true? What happened at
last year’s company picnic?

_Stephen:_ When I first arrived, it was difficult. I stood off to the side and didn’t say
much to others. After a while, people started to include me in their conver-
sations and it got easier. I think it was especially difficult last year because I
had just started at the company and didn’t know anyone very well.

_Therapist:_ Were you able to think of things to say?

_Stephen:_ At first, I struggled. I think it was harder for me than it was for the others,
but I was able to think of a few things to talk about, especially later in the
afternoon.

_Therapist:_ Did everyone at last year’s picnic bring a partner or spouse? Did they all talk
about their children?

_Stephen:_ No. In fact, there are a few other single people at work. Last year, lots of
people ended up talking about work.

_Therapist:_ Thinking back to last year’s company picnic, do you still think that you
won’t have anything to say at this year’s picnic?

_Stephen:_ Well, I may not be as talkative as some other people, but I suppose I will
probably find something to talk about. Maybe it will be easier this year
because I’ve worked with these people for over a year, so I know them much
better.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Challenging Catastrophic Thinking

Challenging catastrophic thinking requires shifting the focus of your thoughts from
how terrible a particular outcome would be to how you might manage or cope with
the situation if it were to occur. One of the most effective ways of overcoming your
catastrophic thoughts is to ask yourself questions like the following:

```
UÊ So what?
```
```
UÊ What if my fears actually come true?
```
```
UÊ How can I cope with if it were to occur?
```
```
UÊ Would really be as terrible as I think?
```
```
UÊ Does this really matter in the big scheme of things?
```
```
UÊ Will I care about this a month from now? A year from now?
```
In many cases, you will realize that even if your fear does come true, it won’t be the
end of the world. You will cope with the situation, and your discomfort will pass. Below
you will see a discussion between Aimee and her therapist illustrating how to use this
technique to challenge catastrophic thoughts related to asking someone out on a date.

_Aimee:_ I am terrified of asking anyone out on a date for fear of rejection.

_Therapist:_ Is there a particular person whom you have considered asking out?

_Aimee:_ There is a guy in one of my classes. I’ve sat with him a few times. The class
ends just before lunch, so I’ve thought of asking him to have lunch with
me.

_Therapist:_ What’s stopping you? What do you think might happen if you ask him to
join you for lunch?

_Aimee:_ Mostly, I am afraid he won’t be interested in me. I will put him on the spot
and he’ll have to come up with an excuse for rejecting my offer. I’m afraid
he’ll think I’m stupid, or even worse, he’ll feel sorry for me.

_Therapist:_ As we’ve discussed previously, there are many different possible reactions
that he could have. Thinking you’re stupid or feeling sorry for you are just
two of many possibilities. Nevertheless, let’s assume for a moment that your
fears actually are true. What if he does think you are foolish and pathetic?

_Aimee:_ I don’t know. I hadn’t really thought beyond that. I would feel terrible.


```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
_Therapist:_ Would it mean that you really are pathetic and stupid?

_Aimee:_ I suppose not.

_Therapist:_ Would it mean that all other people also think you are stupid and
pathetic?

_Aimee:_ Not really.

_Therapist:_ Why not?

_Aimee:_ Well, his opinion doesn’t reflect that of other people. I know my friends
don’t think I’m pathetic. At least I hope not.

_Therapist:_ If you’re not stupid or pathetic, why else would he reject you?

_Aimee:_ Perhaps he might have other lunch plans. Or, maybe he already has a
girlfriend.

_Therapist:_ Those are both possibilities, but let’s come back to your original thoughts.
What if he really thinks you’re pathetic and that’s why he isn’t interested in
spending time with you?

_Aimee:_ I guess it wouldn’t matter. Over the past few weeks, I’ve come to recognize
that not everyone has to like me. Perhaps it would mean that we’re just not
a good match.

_Therapist:_ If he declines your offer for lunch, do you think you will be able to cope
with the feelings of rejection?

_Aimee:_ I think so. It will feel bad at first, but I think I can stop myself from getting
too down on myself.

Overcoming catastrophic thinking also involves combating the tendencies to con-
centrate only on the immediate consequences of some negative experience (for example,
“People will think badly about me during my presentation”) and to forget that your
discomfort will pass after a short time. In reality, the consequences of making a mistake
or of embarrassing yourself are usually minimal and almost never last very long. Even if
people notice that you have made a mistake or that you appear to be anxious, they are
likely to forget about it after a few minutes.
We have included a Decatastrophizing Form toward the end of this chapter to help
you challenge your catastrophic thoughts in social situations. The form includes three
columns. In the first column, you should describe the situation that led you to feel
anxious. In the second column, describe your anxious thoughts and predictions. Now,
ask the questions provided in the previous bulleted list (such as, “So what?”) and record
your noncatastrophic responses in the third column. Following are some examples.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
Column 1 (Examples of Situations)
```
```
UÊ Giving a presentation
```
```
UÊ Having difficulty thinking of things to say during a conversation
```
```
UÊ Attending a party
```
```
UÊ Asking someone out on a date
```
```
UÊ Walking through a busy mall
```
```
Column 2 (Examples of Anxious Thoughts)
```
```
UÊ will think I am stupid.
```
```
UÊ My hands will shake.
```
```
UÊ I will look weak or incompetent.
```
```
UÊ will feel sorry for me.
```
```
UÊ My anxiety will be noticed by.
```
```
Column 3 (Examples of Noncatastrophic Responses)
```
```
UÊ Even if thinks I’m an idiot, it doesn’t mean I
really am one. His opinion doesn’t reflect that of everyone else.
```
```
UÊ It wouldn’t be the end of the world if noticed
my anxiety. Everyone feels anxious from time to time.
```
```
UÊ Who cares if my hands shake? I have the right to have shaky hands. Probably
no one will even notice. Even if they notice, they probably won’t care. My
boss has shaky hands and nobody seems to care.
```
```
UÊ If I am ridiculed or laughed at, it would be manageable. Most people get
teased and ridiculed from time to time. I certainly laugh at other people
sometimes. Other than the temporary discomfort or embarrassment, it
wouldn’t really matter in the big scheme of things.
```
Remembering Your Strengths

If you tend to focus on small mistakes and perceived flaws in your personality or
appearance, you will likely continue to feel anxious. For example, if you assume that
everyone is judging you based on whether your hands shake, you are more likely to


```
Changing Your Anxious Thoughts and Expectations
```
be nervous when your hands are shaking. Similarly, if you assume that everyone else
is criticizing you based on ten seconds during your presentation when you lost your
train of thought, you will probably continue to be nervous when giving presentations.
Although it is true that we all judge and criticize other people from time to time, it is
unlikely that people are noticing and judging the specific behaviors that you assume are
being criticized.
People’s judgments of one another are based on many different dimensions, includ-
ing appearance (for example, height, weight, hair color and style, facial features, cloth-
ing, shoes, and so on), intelligence (for instance, verbal abilities, problem-solving skills,
knowledge of trivia, and so on), competence (such as abilities to do one’s job well,
computer skills, ability to fix things around the house), work habits (for example, ten-
dency to arrive on time, work hard, and not take overly long breaks), athletic abilities
(like the ability to play tennis, fitness level, strength), creativity (for instance, musical
or artistic ability), health habits (such as diet, exercise, smoking, drinking), health status
(presence of medical problems), social status (type of home, income, type of job), mood
(happy, excited, sad, angry, fearful), and personality (generosity, empathy, confidence,
politeness, arrogance), to name just a few.
Most of us are far above average on some dimensions, far below average on some
other dimensions, and well within average range on most dimensions. The extent to
which a person criticizes you about a particular dimension probably depends on whether
that person believes that particular domain is important. Although some people may
criticize you for appearing nervous, it’s likely that most people couldn’t care less. If you
assume others are focusing only on those dimensions in which you judge yourself to be
inferior, you will continue to feel anxious and fearful around other people.
Because your natural tendency may be to focus on those areas in which you feel you
don’t measure up to others, it may take some practice to recognize dimensions in which
you excel or in which you are similar to most other people. As a start, it may be helpful
to list some of your strengths in the space provided below.

**Areas of Strength**

Seeing Yourself as Others Do

One powerful method for challenging the overly harsh standards that you may hold
for yourself is to try to see anxiety-provoking situations through another person’s per-
spective. What if the tables were turned and a close friend came to you for advice and


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

support after giving a presentation? What if your friend expressed many of the same
thoughts that you experience when you are in a feared social or performance situation?
What might you say?
For example, what if your friend said to you, “I totally blew my presentation. My
voice was trembling, and at one point I even lost my train of thought. I’m sure I looked
like a complete idiot.” How would you respond to your friend? Most likely you would say
something like, “You probably did better than you think. Even if you did look anxious,
people probably didn’t care.” Or, perhaps you would say something like, “I also feel very
anxious during presentations. It feels very uncomfortable in the moment, but eventually
it passes.”
It is often much easier to challenge someone else’s anxious thoughts than it is to
challenge your own. Therefore, we suggest that you try coping with your own anxious
thoughts by mentally “stepping out” of the situation for a moment. Imagine that it is
someone else (perhaps a close friend or family member) who is experiencing the anxiety.
What might you tell him or her? Taking the perspective of a close friend may help you
to challenge your own anxious thoughts.
Another helpful method of shifting perspectives is to imagine how you might judge
someone else who exhibits the same anxious behaviors that you do. For example, if you
are worried that others might criticize you if your voice become shaky, you might ask
yourself, “Am I critical of other people when I notice their voice shaking?” Most likely,
you would not assume someone else to be incompetent, stupid, or weak just because he
or she seems a bit shy or anxious in a particular situation. Well, the same is true of other
people. It is unlikely that they will make such harsh judgments of you, even if they do
notice that you’re anxious.
A third strategy for shifting perspectives is to ask yourself how someone who isn’t
anxious might interpret the situation you fear. For example, if you believe that it’s impor-
tant to avoid parties if there is any risk at all of looking anxious, you can ask yourself
how someone who isn’t anxious might view that situation. You can even imagine how
a particular person (for example, a friend, relative, spouse, or therapist) might view the
situation.
To summarize, shifting your perspectives involves asking yourself three types of
questions:

```
UÊ What might I say to a close friend or relative who was having the same
thought as me?
```
```
UÊ How might I view someone else who was exhibiting the same behavior as
me (shaking, sweating, making a mistake, and so on)?
```
```
UÊ How might someone without an anxiety problem view this situation?
```

```

Examining the Costs and Benefits of Your Thoughts

As we have discussed throughout this chapter, anxious thoughts about social and per-
formance situations are often untrue. However, sometimes they may be true (at least par-
tially true) and still be a problem. In addition to establishing whether your thoughts are
true, it’s useful to consider whether your thoughts and behaviors are helping you. If they
are helpful, then they may be worth holding on to. If not, it may be time to let them go.
Almost everyone wants to make a good impression and probably no one would
choose to be thought of as incompetent, stupid, boring, or weak. In fact, many of the
anxiety-provoking beliefs held by individuals with excessive social anxiety are similar in
content to those held by people who don’t have problems with social anxiety. Beliefs
such as “It is important to be liked by other people” and “It is important to make a posi-
tive impression” are often helpful beliefs that most of us develop early in life. Making a
good impression on others helps us to develop friendships, get promoted at work, and
impress our teachers. In fact, many rewards in life depend on being able to influence
others in a positive way.
However, excessive social anxiety is usually associated with a tendency to be overly
concerned with the opinions of others—so much so that it interferes with your life and
may actually lead to a more negative impression on others, particularly if you avoid
important social events. The problem with the beliefs and thoughts associated with
social anxiety is not necessarily that they are untrue (although sometimes they are), but
rather that they are held in an exaggerated and inflexible way. For example, if the belief
“I should make a good impression on others” motivates you to do a good job at work,
that’s great. If, on the other hand, the same belief makes you feel paralyzed and unable
to get any work done, that’s a problem.
In addition to establishing the accuracy of your anxious beliefs and predictions, it
may also be helpful to consider whether your thoughts and behaviors are helping you.
Following is a form that you can use for this exercise. If you are unsure about whether
a particular anxiety-provoking thought is true or false, try examining the costs and ben-
efits of constantly dwelling on the thought. How would the quality of your life improve
if you didn’t have the thought?

Rational Coping Statements

At the height of your fear, it may be difficult to challenge your anxious thoughts
using some of the techniques described in this chapter. You may find that your attention
is completely focused on trying to get through the situation, and it may seem impossible
to think logically. Rational coping statements are relatively easy to use and don’t require
the same level of logical analysis as other techniques, such as examining the evidence
and evaluating the costs and benefits of your anxious thoughts. Rational coping state-
ments are short “nonanxious” sentences that may help to combat your anxious thinking.
Examples include the following:

```
UÊ It would be manageable if didn’t like me.
```
```
UÊ It’s okay to blush in front of others.
```
```
UÊ Panic attacks are uncomfortable but not dangerous.
```
```
UÊ It is okay to look anxious during a presentation.
```
```
UÊ People don’t seem to notice my shaky hands.
```
You may find it helpful to write or type several coping statements on an index card
and carry the card with you as a reminder. When you are in an anxiety-provoking situ-
ation, you can take the card out of your wallet or purse and remind yourself of one or
more of these statements, thereby combating your anxious thoughts. Choose statements
that are most relevant to you. Also, choose statements that are believable. For example,
there is no point telling yourself, “I am not going to be anxious” if you always feel
anxious when giving speeches and you are about to give a speech. A more believable
alternative is, “It’s not the end of the world if I become anxious.”
In the following spaces, record five rational coping statements that are relevant to
your own particular anxious beliefs.

Behavioral Experiments

Cognitive therapy involves examining the validity of your beliefs and thoughts in
the same way that a scientist examines the validity of a scientific theory or hypothesis.
In fact, the experiment is the most powerful strategy scientists have to test their own
beliefs. In cognitive therapy for social anxiety, experiments involve challenging anxious
beliefs by setting up small behavioral tests to see whether a belief is in fact valid. Through
a series of repeated behavioral experiments, it is likely that you will disprove many of
the beliefs and predictions that contribute to your fear and anxiety. Some examples of
specific experiments that can be used to test the validity of various anxiety-provoking
thoughts are listed below.

**Anxiety-Provoking Thought Example of Behavioral Experiment**

It would be terrible to have my hand
shake while I hold a glass of water.

```
Purposely shake your hand while you hold
a glass of water. For a true test of your
beliefs, let the water spill all over you!
Then see if it really is so terrible.
```
I will make a fool of myself at my job
interview tomorrow, so why bother going?

```
Go to the job interview and see what
happens.
```
I can’t cope with being the center of
attention.

```
Do something to draw attention to your-
self. For example, arrive to class late, drop
your keys, wear your shirt inside out, or
knock over some unbreakable items in a
supermarket.
```
It would be terrible to seem stupid or
incompetent.

```
Line up at a store and after your items
have been rung up, explain to the cashier
that you have forgotten your money.
```
I will be rejected if I ask a coworker to
have dinner with me.

```
Invite your coworker for dinner and check
out his or her reaction.
```
When selecting possible experiments, try to choose practices in which you have
little to lose. For example, don’t tell your boss how much you hate him, just to see what
happens! Try to select experiments in which the worst that will happen is possible dis-
comfort or temporary embarrassment. Remember that the more social risks you take, the
more often they will pay off. Along the way, however, you will also experience rejection
from time to time. If you don’t take risks, you will never be rejected—but you will also


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

never experience the benefits of taking social risks, including improved relationships, a
better job, and other possible rewards.
In the spaces below, imagine and record some experiments you could try in order to
test out your particular anxious thoughts. In the first column, write down your anxious
belief. In the second column, design a small experiment that will provide a good test of
whether your belief is true.

**Anxious Thought Behavioral Experiment**

The next few chapters discuss strategies for confronting the very situations and
feelings that you fear. As you will see, exposure to feared situations is actually a type
of behavioral experiment. By repeatedly exposing yourself to situations that make you
anxious, you will learn that your fears often don’t materialize.

USING A THOUGHT RECORD OR

COGNITIVE DIARY

Throughout this chapter, we have included various forms and diaries to be used for
challenging anxious thoughts. In this section, we now provide a more general Social
Anxiety Thought Record that can be used whenever you experience anxiety in a social
situation. Unlike the other forms in this chapter, which are each designed for use with a
particular technique (examining the evidence, overcoming catastrophic thinking, and so
on), the Social Anxiety Thought Record is designed to be used with any of the cognitive
strategies. At the end of this chapter is a blank form, as well as a completed sample.
It really doesn’t matter which form you use to record and change your thoughts. You
can use the forms provided in this chapter, or you can design your own. The diaries in
this chapter are only suggestions. The main point of these diaries is to get you into the
habit of paying attention to your thoughts and actively trying to change them. Once
the new patterns of thinking become second nature, it will no longer be necessary to
record your thoughts on paper. In the meantime, we recommend that you use some
type of diary or form several times per week after encountering feared social or perfor-
mance situations. The best times to complete the forms are either before entering the
situation (as a way of preparing for the encounter) or immediately afterward (as a way of
challenging any anxious thoughts that occurred while you were in the situation).


```

```
Instructions for Completing the Social Anxiety
Thought Record
```
```
Column 1: Date and Time
Record the date and time.
```
**Column 2: Situation**
Describe the situation or trigger for your fear. Typical examples might include the
following:

```
UÊ Gave a presentation
```
```
UÊ Went to a meeting
```
```
UÊ Person was watching me on the subway
```
```
UÊ Ate lunch with a coworker
```
```
UÊ I was blushing
```
```
UÊ My hands shook in front of my boss
```
```
UÊ Went to a party
```
```
UÊ Had to do an oral book-report for class
```
```
UÊ Was introduced to my sister’s new boyfriend
```
```
UÊ Went on a blind date
```
**Column 3: Anxiety-Provoking Thoughts and Predictions**
In the third column, list any anxious thoughts that occur in response to the situa-
tion and triggers reported in column 2. Usually these thoughts will be predictions of
danger, embarrassment, and so on. Often these thoughts will be automatic or almost
unconscious. It will take practice to identify them. Try to come up with very specific
thoughts. A thought such as, “Something bad will happen” is too vague. Typical examples
of specific anxious thoughts include the following:

```
UÊ People will notice my blushing and think I am strange
```
```
UÊ People will notice that I am nervous
```
```
UÊ I will make a fool of myself
```
```
UÊ People will think I am stupid
```
```
UÊ People will see me for the idiot I really am
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ People will think I’m ugly
```
```
UÊ I will have to leave the situation
```
```
UÊ I am incompetent and clumsy
```
```
UÊ I need an alcoholic drink to feel comfortable
```
```
UÊ People can always tell how I am feeling
```
```
UÊ Anxiety is a sign of weakness
```
```
UÊ I’ll be viewed as boring
```
```
UÊ People will not like me
```
```
UÊ I will have nothing to say
```
**Column 4: Anxiety Before (0–100)**
Rate your anxiety level before countering your anxiety-provoking thoughts. Use a 0
to 100 point scale, where 0 = no anxiety and 100 = extreme anxiety.

**Column 5: Alternative Thoughts and Predictions**
Record examples of alternative thoughts and predictions. For example, if you believe
that people will think you are strange if you blush, alternative predictions might include
such thoughts as (1) nobody will notice my blushing, (2) people who notice my blushing
will think I am hot or not feeling well, and (3) people who notice my blushing will think
nothing of it.

**Column 6: Evidence and Realistic Conclusions**
Consider the evidence for your anxiety-provoking thoughts as well as your alterna-
tive thoughts. For example, if you fear blushing, you might record your observations that
most people don’t mention that they notice your blushing, and that even when people
do notice that you are blushing, they still seem to enjoy your company and they still
treat you well. In this column, you should also record a realistic conclusion based on the
evidence. For example, you might record, “Many people don’t seem to notice my blush-
ing, and even when someone does notice it, there are no real consequences other than
my temporary embarrassment.”

**Column 7: Anxiety After (0–100)**
Rate your anxiety level after countering your anxiety-provoking thoughts. Use a 0
to 100 point scale, where 0 = no anxiety and 100 = extreme anxiety.

INTEGRATING COGNITIVE STRATEGIES INTO

YOUR TREATMENT PLAN

The cognitive techniques described in this chapter are not meant to be used on their
own. Rather, they should be used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan that includes
exposure to feared situations. Exposure-based treatments are discussed in chapters 7
through 9. We recommend that you first practice the cognitive techniques for a few
weeks before formally beginning exposure practices. Learning to manage your anxiety
by changing your thinking will help you when confronting the situations that you fear.
In addition to exposure and cognitive therapy, your treatment may also include medica-
tion (see chapter 5) and social-skills practices (see chapter 10), depending on your own
personal needs and preferences.

A WORD TO SIGNIFICANT OTHERS, FRIENDS,

AND FAMILY MEMBERS

If you are working with a loved one who is trying to overcome his or her social anxiety,
you can help him or her to change anxiety-provoking thoughts into more realistic
thoughts by engaging in calm, logical discussions about the situations he or she fears.
This process should always be done in a supportive way, and you should be careful
not to put your loved one down for having anxiety-provoking beliefs (after all, we all
have irrational thoughts from time to time). You should also be careful not to tell your
loved one what he or she _should_ be thinking. Rather, your loved one should draw his or
her own conclusions based on the evidence. Finally, remember that your role is to be
supportive—not to nag or pressure your loved one into making changes or to argue
about how to interpret anxiety-provoking situations. You and your loved one should
discuss what role he or she would like you to have, and how you can best facilitate the
process of change.

TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** I have difficulty identifying my anxious thoughts.

**Solution:** Ask yourself questions such as, “What might think
about me?” and “What do I think will happen in this situation?” If, after
trying to answer these questions, you are still unable to identify your
anxious beliefs, try to detect your thoughts while you are actually in
the situation you fear. If you are unable to identify specific thoughts and
predictions, don’t worry. You can still benefit from the exposure-based
strategies discussed in chapters 7 through 9.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

**Problem:** I have difficulty believing the alternative, nonanxious, rational
thoughts.

**Solution:** Sometimes the cognitive techniques seem superficial when a person first
starts to use them. Over time, the new nonanxious thoughts should
become more believable. If not, the exposure-based strategies (chap-
ters 7 through 9) are among the most powerful methods for changing
anxious thoughts and will likely help. Sometimes, changing thoughts
through firsthand experience in a feared situation is more effective than
trying to change thoughts by simply trying to think differently.

**Problem:** When I am in a social situation, I am too anxious to think clearly, so I
can’t use the cognitive strategies.

**Solution:** Try using the cognitive strategies before you enter the situation. If this
is not practical, try using them after you have been in the situation for
a while (your fear should decrease over time) or even after leaving the
situation.

**Problem:** I can’t be bothered completing the monitoring forms. They are confus-
ing, and they take too long to complete.

**Solution:** There are many different ways to learn the techniques described in
this chapter. The forms and diaries are designed to make the process
easier. However, if they are getting in the way of using the strategies,
try developing a simpler form (for example, you may want to use a two-
column form—with one column for recording your anxious thoughts
and another column for recording your new nonanxious thoughts).
Alternatively, you can even forget about the forms and diaries and
simply use the techniques in your head.

A SUMMARY GUIDE TO CHALLENGING

THOUGHTS

This chapter includes a large number of suggestions and strategies for identifying and
changing your anxious thoughts. Now that you have had a chance to read through the
chapter and complete some of the exercises, we encourage you to continue using the
cognitive techniques to cope with your social and performance anxiety. Generally, using
the cognitive strategies will involve the following steps:

1. Identify your anxious thoughts, predictions, and interpretations.
2. Examine the validity of your anxious predictions using some of the tech-
    niques described in this chapter (such as examining the evidence, taking the
    perspective of others, examining the costs and benefits of your thoughts,
    conducting behavioral experiments). Are your predictions realistic? For
    example, will others really think about
    you?
3. Examine the validity of your catastrophic thoughts by asking the question,
    “So what if my anxious thoughts are true?” For example, “What if a few
    people in the audience really think my presentation is awful? How might I
    cope with that?”
4. Use the Social Anxiety Thought Record to identify and challenge your
    anxious thoughts on paper.

CHAPTER 7

### Confronting Your Fears

### Through Exposure

Chapter 6 provided a detailed overview of cognitive strategies that have been shown to
be useful for changing anxious patterns of thinking. Almost all of the cognitive tech-
niques involve learning to think differently about social and performance situations by
(1) broadening the possible range of interpretations and beliefs that you can hold for a
particular social situation, and (2) considering all the evidence before assuming that a
specific thought is true.
This chapter provides an introduction to a number of techniques that are useful for
changing the behaviors that maintain your anxious beliefs and feelings. Essentially, these
strategies involve confronting your fears directly by exposing yourself to the situations
and the feelings that you currently fear and avoid. This chapter starts with a review of
the behaviors that contribute to social anxiety and a summary of the strategies that can
be used to change these behaviors. The remainder of the chapter provides more detailed
descriptions of the underlying principles of exposure and the best ways of conducting
exposure-based therapy.
Chapters 8 and 9 build directly on the content of this introductory chapter by provid-
ing more in-depth instructions for exposure to social situations (chapter 8) and exposure
to feared sensations (chapter 9). The exercises described in chapters 7 through 9 should
be used after you have had a chance to practice some of the cognitive methods described
in chapter 6. We recommend that you begin to learn about exposure by reading chapters
7 and 8 and that you practice the situational exposure exercises for at least three to five
weeks before moving on to chapter 9. Then, we suggest that you read chapter 9 and make
some attempts to expose yourself to feared sensations, if these exercises are relevant
to you. As reviewed in chapter 9, exposure to physical sensations may be useful if you


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

are fearful of experiencing particular feelings (for instance, sweating, shaking, blushing,
racing heart) associated with being anxious or nervous. If you are not fearful of these
behaviors, then the strategies described in chapter 9 will not be as important.

BEHAVIORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

SOCIAL ANXIETY

All organisms try to avoid situations that cause fear, pain, or discomfort. Avoidance is a
method of protecting oneself from possible danger. In the short term, staying away from
perceived threats is a very effective way of decreasing or preventing these uncomfort-
able feelings. Your experience has probably taught you that confronting feared situations
causes you to feel overwhelmed and that avoiding or escaping from feared situations
leads to a sense of relief. However, avoiding the situations, objects, and feelings that
make you anxious is also a guaranteed way to ensure that your fear will continue over the
long term. The likelihood of threat in the social situations that you avoid is probably very
low. Avoidance can actually do more harm than good, particularly in the long term.
By avoiding the situations that make you uncomfortable, it may seem as though you
prevent your feared negative consequences from occurring. Just as a person who fears
flying may believe that avoiding a flight has protected him or her from experiencing
a possible plane crash, you may believe that avoiding social or performance situations
protects you from experiencing various social catastrophes, such as being humiliated or
criticized by others. Of course, statistically, the risk of dying in a plane crash is close
to zero (about one in ten million, according to some sources). In other words, the risk
of being in a plane crash is almost identical (close to zero) whether you fly or not! The
same may be said of public speaking, attending parties, and other social situations. The
risk of actual threat or danger is significantly less than socially anxious individuals usually
assume. In fact, the long-term consequences of avoiding social situations are often far
greater than the risks of confronting these situations.
Exposure to feared situations and feelings is a very powerful method of learning that
avoidance is neither necessary nor helpful in the long run. By confronting your fears, you
will discover that many of your anxiety-provoking beliefs and interpretations are untrue
or exaggerated. In addition, your interpersonal skills will improve as you will have more
opportunities to practice various types of social interaction and performance. In other
words, not only will you become more comfortable making small talk, giving speeches,
or dealing with conflict situations, you will also become more effective and competent
at mastering these challenging situations.
There are three main types of anxious behaviors that we will review here. Each of
these is a potentially harmful habit because it prevents your fear from decreasing over
the long term. These behaviors include (1) avoiding feared social and performance situa-
tions, (2) avoiding feared sensations and feelings, and (3) subtle avoidance strategies and
safety behaviors.


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
Avoidance of Social Situations

Avoiding social situations such as public speaking, making conversation, attending
meetings, dating, and working out at the gym prevents you from learning that these
situations are safe and that your fears are generally unwarranted. Escaping early from
these situations (for instance, leaving a party after a few minutes) can also have a nega-
tive impact on your fear by reinforcing your experience that being in the situation makes
you uncomfortable, and leaving the situation provides relief and a reduction in fear. In
reality, staying in a situation despite the fear that it arouses also leads to a reduction in
fear. Fear may take longer to decrease when you stay in the situation, but the long-term
benefits will be greater. By staying until your fear decreases, you will learn that you can
be right in the middle of the situation and feel relatively comfortable. Strategies for
overcoming avoidance of feared situations are discussed throughout this chapter, as well
as in chapter 8.

Avoidance of Feared Sensations

As we discussed previously, in addition to avoiding certain situations, you may also
avoid feeling certain sensations or feelings, particularly in social situations. Perhaps you
avoid eating hot foods that cause you to feel flushed when you’re dining with friends or
relatives. Alternatively, you may avoid wearing warm clothes while speaking in public, in
case they cause you to sweat. Avoiding sensations such as sweating and blushing reinforces
your beliefs that these sensations and feelings are dangerous. If you are fearful of expe-
riencing particular symptoms in the presence of others, you will likely find that exposing
yourself to these feelings can help you to become more comfortable with them. The goal
is to reach a point at which sensations, like shaking or a racing heartbeat, are, at worst,
mildly uncomfortable but not frightening. The general principles discussed throughout
this chapter will be relevant to overcoming your fear of physical symptoms. However,
specific exercises for overcoming these fears are discussed more thoroughly in chapter 9.

Subtle Avoidance Strategies and Safety Behaviors

Subtle avoidance behaviors (also called _safety behaviors_ ) are not-so-obvious strate-
gies that people often use to cope with anxiety-provoking situations. Unlike completely
avoiding a feared situation, subtle avoidance strategies involve partial avoidance of the
situation. Often these behaviors are not noticeable to others. In fact, they may be so
subtle that even you are not aware of them. As is the case with more obvious types of
avoidance, learning to let go of your subtle forms of escape will help you to overcome
your fear, just as removing training wheels is an important step in learning to ride a
bicycle, and letting go of crutches is an important step in relearning to walk after an
injury. We will now discuss some examples of subtle avoidance strategies.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

**Distraction.** Distraction involves escaping from anxious thoughts and feelings by focus-
ing on thoughts or images that are more pleasant or by keeping yourself busy with
distracting activities. For example, while attending a party, you might offer to help serve
food or drinks so that you are constantly busy with some activity and your mind is dis-
tracted from the anxious feelings that you might otherwise be experiencing. Or, while
traveling on a bus or train, you might always be sure to bring a book or portable radio
to distract yourself from feeling anxious about making eye contact with others or from
thinking about what others might be thinking about you. Such distractions may help you
to feel comfortable while in social or performance situations, but in the long term they
prevent you from learning that you can manage the situation without having to rely on
subtle avoidance.

**Overprotective behaviors.** Overprotective behaviors are small things that you may do
to feel safer in the situations that you fear. Examples may include the following:

```
UÊ Wearing extra makeup or a turtleneck sweater to hide blushing
```
```
UÊ Finding out who else will be at a party before deciding whether to attend
```
```
UÊ Wearing gloves to hide shaking hands
```
```
UÊ Sitting down or leaning against a podium while giving a presentation
```
```
UÊ Eating in a dimly lit restaurant so your date won’t notice your anxiety
```
```
UÊ Wearing sunglasses to help avoid making eye contact
```
```
UÊ Always attending social events with a friend so you can avoid talking to
people who you don’t know well
```
When designing exposure practices, it is important that you also try to eliminate
these subtle safety behaviors.

**Overcompensating for perceived deficits.** Overcompensating involves working extra
hard to make sure that your fearful predictions don’t come true. For example, if you
are afraid of looking foolish during a presentation, you may spend days rehearsing and
memorizing what you will say. If you’re fearful of making small talk, you may spend
hours preparing topics of conversation and rehearsing what you might talk about. If
you are afraid of looking unattractive, you may put too much effort into fixing your
hair, choosing your clothes, or building your muscles at the gym. In many cases, these
situations might be managed with less effort, leaving time and energy for other things.
Exposure practices should be designed to eliminate any tendencies to overprepare or
overcompensate for flaws that may not even be present. For example, instead of spend-
ing hours memorizing a presentation, try giving your talk with only minimal (but still
adequate) preparation.


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
**Excessive checking and reassurance seeking.** Excessive checking involves spending too
much time and effort trying to find out whether you are perceived by others in a positive
light. We all engage in occasional checking (for example, looking in the mirror at a party,
asking a coworker whether she enjoyed your presentation). In fact, we recommend that
you occasionally continue to check on other people’s reactions to you and your actions.
Checking and receiving reassurance are helpful ways of testing out your beliefs. However,
if you ask for reassurance or check too frequently, this may be a behavior you want to
decrease. The key is moderation. Occasional checking is helpful, but constant checking
can be a problem. Constantly obtaining reassurance about your performance is like con-
stantly checking with your doctor whenever you experience an unusual sensation. Never
going to the doctor may cause you serious health problems that might otherwise have
been detected early or prevented. But going to the doctor several times a week to check
out every ache and pain can backfire; your doctor may stop taking your concerns and
complaints seriously. Constant requests for reassurance can also backfire, having the exact
effect that you are trying to avoid—namely a negative response from others.

**Substance use.** Substance use can undermine the effects of exposure by artificially low-
ering your level of fear in social and performance situations. For exposure to be effec-
tive, it’s important for you to experience some degree of fear. It is also important for
you to learn that your fear will usually decrease naturally if you stay in the situation.
Drinking alcohol or using other drugs whenever you are in a situation that makes you
anxious will prevent you from learning that your anxiety will decrease even without the
drug or alcohol. When designing exposure practices, we recommend that you not drink
alcohol or use drugs during the practice. If you want to have a glass of wine or a beer at
a party, try to wait until after your fear has decreased somewhat.

A STEP-BY-STEP OVERVIEW FOR CONDUCTING

EXPOSURE-BASED TREATMENTS

The main steps involved in any exposure-based treatment program are initial assessment,
planning appropriate practices, carrying out the practices, and taking steps to maintain
the improvements over the long term.

Initial Assessment

We discussed the issue of assessment in chapter 3. To plan effective exposure prac-
tices, you will need to know the situations and sensations that you fear and avoid as
well as becoming aware of the different variables that affect your fear level. When you
completed the exercises in chapter 3, you probably identified a number of variables
that affect your fear level when you are in a social or performance situation that causes
you to feel uncomfortable. You should review the relevant sections of chapter 3 before
beginning your exposure practices.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Planning Appropriate Practices

Planning your exposure practices starts with developing an _exposure hierarchy_. An expo-
sure hierarchy is a list of feared situations ranked in order of difficulty, from least fear
provoking at the bottom, to most fear provoking at the top. Chapter 8 provides exam-
ples of hierarchies and includes instructions on how to develop your own hierarchy for
situational exposure. Chapter 9 provides sample hierarchies and instructions for devel-
oping a hierarchy for exposure to feared sensations. Developing an exposure hierarchy
will provide a structure that will allow you to begin with easier exercises and work your
way up to more difficult ones.

Carrying Out the Practices

Once you’ve identified some practices likely to be helpful, the next step is to begin
carrying them out. Generally, exposure begins with more manageable situations and
works up to more and more difficult situations. As confronting the situations becomes
easier, you should begin to let go of the subtle forms of avoidance that were discussed
earlier. Later, after practicing situational exposure for several weeks (as described in
chapter 8), it may be useful to add exercises involving exposure to feared feelings and
sensations (as described in chapter 9).
Exposure practices should be structured, planned in advance, and carried out fre-
quently. The ways in which exposure practices are carried out affect whether the prac-
tices are helpful or not. Exposure can actually increase your fear if not done properly.
The remaining sections of this chapter provide suggestions for the best ways to conduct
exposure to maximize the chances of decreasing your fear.

Maintaining Your Improvements

In order to maintain your improvements, it’s important that you continue occasional
practices even after your fear has decreased. These strategies are explored in greater
detail in chapter 11.

TYPES OF EXPOSURE

This section discusses three different dimensions that should be taken into account when
planning exposure practices. They are (1) exposure to social situations vs. feared sensa-
tions; (2) imagined vs. live exposure; and (3) gradual vs. rapid exposure.


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
Exposure to Social Situations vs. Feared Sensations

Situational exposure involves exposing oneself to places and situations that produce
anxiety. Overcoming social and performance anxiety almost always includes situational
exposure as a component. In other words, to become more comfortable with public
speaking, meeting strangers, or lunching with your coworkers, you will need to practice
these activities.
Some people with social and performance anxiety may also benefit from exposure to
sensations. This form of exposure is sometimes called _interoceptive exposure,_ and it involves
practicing exercises that trigger particular physical sensations. For example, spinning in a
chair can be used to induce dizziness, and running up and down the stairs will make your
heart race. Exposure to sensations is useful for people who are fearful of experiencing
uncomfortable physical feelings.
If you are not afraid of the physical sensations that you experience when anxious,
there is no need to practice these exercises. However, if you are frightened by the physi-
cal sensations you experience in social situations, you may find it helpful to practice
experiencing these feelings purposely until they no longer frighten you. Exposure to
sensations can be combined with situational exposure so that feared physical feelings are
purposefully brought on during the course of the exposure to feared situations. Chapter
9 provides a detailed description of how to use interoceptive exposure to reduce your
fear of sensations.

Imagined vs. Live Exposure

Exposure can be conducted in your imagination (imagining being in a feared situa-
tion) or in real life (actually entering the feared situation). Generally, whenever possible,
we recommend that live exposure (also called _in vivo exposure_ ) be used rather than imag-
ined exposure. Although both approaches can lead to a reduction of fear, live exposure
has two big advantages. First, some people have difficulty imagining feared situations in
a way that actually arouses their fear; and, second, there is evidence that live exposure
is more effective at reducing fear (Emmelkamp and Wessels 1975).
Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, imagined exposure may be helpful. If
you are too fearful to enter a situation in real life, you can use imagined exposure as a
stepping-stone to the real situation. For example, if you are planning to ask someone out
on a date, you might consider using an imagined exposure to the situation at first. Once
you have become more comfortable imagining the situation, trying the real thing might
become easier. Also, imagined exposure can be helpful when the situation is impracti-
cal or impossible to practice in real life. For example, if you must give a presentation
to a group of 200 people, you may not be able to practice it in front of a large group.
Instead, imagining a large group in your mind’s eye might be a good way to practice for
the actual presentation when you are preparing your talk.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

_Situational role-play_ is a compromise between imagined exposure and live exposure.
Role-play involves rehearsing being in a particular situation with the help of a friend,
family member, or therapist. For example, before exposing yourself to a real job interview,
you could practice mock interviews with other individuals posing as the interviewers.
Or, you could ask your family or friends to act as the audience while you practice a pre-
sentation. These various forms of situational exposure (imagined, in vivo, and role-plays)
are discussed more thoroughly in chapter 8.

Gradual vs. Rapid Exposure

Exposure may be conducted gradually or rapidly. Rapid exposure involves taking
steps very quickly, skipping steps, and sometimes trying more difficult situations before
you have completely mastered easier situations. For example, rapid exposure to public
speaking might have you start off with talking in front of large groups of unfamiliar
people instead of to small groups of familiar people.
Gradual exposure tends to begin with easier practices and progresses to the more
difficult practices much more slowly. Compared with rapid exposure, a person who is
working on gradual exposure may spend more time practicing each step before moving
on to the next level of difficulty. In addition, gradual exposure is less likely to leave out
intermediate steps, compared with rapid exposure. With gradual exposure, by the time
you get to the top steps of your hierarchy, you will be better prepared and less likely to
feel overwhelmed by the practice.
Gradual exposure is similar to progressing through school one grade at a time. If
you had to jump from ninth grade to twelfth grade, you would likely find the increase
in difficulty overwhelming. By progressing through high school one grade at a time, you
find each grade to be just slightly more difficult than the previous grade. By the time
you get to twelfth grade, the increase in difficulty is only a small step compared with
your work in eleventh grade.
Gradual exposure to public speaking might begin by presenting small speeches in
front of a close friend or family member or by asking questions at meetings. After those
practice situations become easier, you might try speaking for longer periods of time
during meetings or practicing a speech in front of a small group of friends or family
members. This could then progress to practicing your speech in front of several cowork-
ers. With gradual exposure, you might not actually speak in front of large groups of
unfamiliar people until many earlier steps have been mastered.
Gradual and rapid exposure are both effective ways of reducing fear, and the end
result of each is usually the same. However, each approach has advantages and disadvan-
tages over the other. With rapid exposure it is likely you will see changes more quickly,
which will save you time. Also, these quick results may motivate you to work even harder
at overcoming your fear, just as seeing quick changes in your weight or fitness level can
motivate you to stick to an exercise and healthy-eating plan. However, compared with
gradual exposure, rapid exposure is associated with higher levels of discomfort and fear.


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
Rapid exposure requires a strong commitment from you to tolerate higher levels of
discomfort.
The differences between these two forms of exposure can be compared to the
difference between jumping into a cold swimming pool and entering the pool slowly.
Jumping into the pool quickly causes more initial discomfort, but you get used to the
water more quickly. On the other hand, getting into the pool slowly and gradually may
be less shocking to your system, but it will take you longer to get used to the water.
We recommend that you practice exposures as quickly as you are willing to. If you
are able to take steps more quickly, you will overcome your anxiety more quickly. If
you prefer a more gradual approach, that’s fine, too. Sometimes, you may find it dif-
ficult to judge whether a particular step is too difficult. Remember, there is no harm in
taking steps too quickly. If an exercise ends up becoming too overwhelming, you have
the option of continuing to practice it until it becomes easier or stepping back, trying a
less difficult exercise, and working your way up to the difficult practice more gradually.
Either approach is likely to be helpful. The decision is a matter of personal preference
and how much discomfort you’re willing to tolerate.

HOW EXPOSURE WORKS

Many cognitive-behavioral researchers and therapists believe that exposure works by
providing individuals with an opportunity to test the validity of their fearful thoughts,
assumptions, and interpretations. In chapter 6, we discussed the use of behavioral experi-
ments for challenging anxious beliefs and predictions. Repeated exposure may be thought
of as a form of behavioral experiment. By entering feared situations and exposing your-
self to feared sensations repeatedly, you will discover whether your beliefs about social
and performance situations are true or false.

Why Exposure May Not Have Worked in the Past

People who are about to begin exposure-based treatments often wonder why they
should expect exposure to work now if it hasn’t worked in the past. In all likelihood,
you’ve already been exposed to anxiety-provoking social situations from time to time
and, in many cases, your fear has probably not decreased. In fact, your anxiety may have
increased with repeated exposures. Given such previous experiences with exposure, you
may be skeptical about whether simply exposing yourself again to feared social situations
will lead to a decrease in your fear.
It’s important to acknowledge that exposure is not effective under all circumstances.
For example, unpredictable exposure can lead to an increase in fear, particularly if it
involves a negative event or consequence. Imagine this situation: You are afraid of dogs
and a dog unexpectedly runs out from behind a tree and starts growling at you. That
kind of exposure would only make your fear worse. On the other hand, if you are


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

gradually exposed to your neighbor’s friendly dog, at your own pace, your fear of dogs
might decrease.
In everyday life, exposure to feared situations is often unpredictable. In addition,
such everyday exposures tend to be brief and infrequent. All of these factors make
exposure in everyday life less likely to lead to a decrease in fear, compared with the type
of exposure that is used in cognitive-behavioral therapy. A summary of the main differ-
ences between the type of exposure you may have experienced in the past (previous
exposure) and the type that has been shown as useful for helping people overcome fear
(therapeutic exposure) appears below.

**Typical Previous Exposures Typical Therapeutic Exposures**

These are often _unpredictable and
uncontrollable_ (e.g., you “end up” in the
middle of an unexpected conversation;
you are “forced” to go to a party that
you would rather not attend).

```
These are predictable and under your control
(e.g., you make a decision to enter an
anxiety-provoking situation specifically
so that you can learn to be more
comfortable in the situation).
```
These have a _brief duration_ (e.g., you get
into the situation, feel anxious, then
leave. This teaches you that when you
are in the situation you feel frightened,
but when you leave you feel better).

```
These are prolonged (e.g., you decide to
stay in a situation until the anxiety comes
down on its own or until you learn that
your feared consequence doesn’t occur.
Here, you learn that you can be in the
situation, nothing bad happens, and your
anxiety eventually subsides).
```
These are _infrequent_ (e.g., because you
usually avoid when anxious, you are
not in the feared situation very often.
Each time you are in the situation, it’s
like starting over).

```
These are frequent (e.g., you practice your
exposures over and over again and close
together. The benefits of exposures start
to add up).
```
These usually involve _anxious thinking_
(e.g., “People think I’m an idiot,”
“People will think I’m incompetent
if they notice my shaky hands”).

```
These include countering of your anxious
thoughts (e.g., you ask yourself questions
to counter or challenge the anxious
beliefs and predictions).
```
These include _subtle ways of avoiding_ the
situation (e.g., by distracting yourself,
using alcohol, bringing someone with
you, sitting in a certain “safe” location).

```
These do not include subtle avoidance strategies
(e.g., you make a decision to not use
these strategies so that you teach your-
self to master the situation on your own).

OBSTACLES TO COMPLETING

EXPOSURE PRACTICES

There are many different reasons why people sometimes don’t follow through on expo-
sure practices. We suggest that you anticipate the possible obstacles in advance and try
to think of ways to overcome them. There are always going to be reasons not to practice.
To combat the excuses you will undoubtedly come up with, you will need to remind
yourself of your reasons to continue to practice despite lack of desire, lack of time, or
being overwhelmed with the idea of confronting situations that make you anxious and
uncomfortable. Here is a listing of some of the most common reasons why people pro-
crastinate when it comes to doing exposure exercises. We’ve also offered some possible
solutions to these problems.

**Obstacle:** My practices are never planned in enough detail, so I am not sure
exactly what I am supposed to do.

**Solution:** At the beginning of each week, plan your exposure practices thoroughly.
You should know exactly what you’re going to do, where you’re going to
do it, and when you’re going to practice (dates and times).

**Obstacle:** Although I have good intentions, my plans never seem to work out. For
example, when I plan to have lunch with a friend, I often find that my
friend isn’t available when I call.

**Solutions:** Make sure you make plans early. Leaving things for the last minute will
make it much more likely that your plans won’t work out.
Be sure to have a backup plan. For example, if you’re planning to have
lunch with a coworker, make sure you have an alternative second plan
and, sometimes, even a third plan, just in case your friend isn’t available
for lunch.

**Obstacle:** I always forget to practice.

**Solutions:** Plan your practices the way you would any other activity in your day.
Set aside blocks of time to practice and record them in your appoint-
ment calendar just as you would for any other appointments, so you
don’t forget.
Set an alarm (e.g., on your wristwatch or a small clock) as a reminder
to practice.
Ask other people to remind you, if necessary.

**Obstacle:** The idea of doing therapeutic exposure work seems overwhelming. I am
just too scared.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

**Solutions:** Start with an easier practice. The activity that you choose should be
challenging but not completely overwhelming. If a particular task seems
impossible, start with an easier task that does seem possible.
Use the cognitive strategies discussed in chapter 6 to challenge your
anxious thoughts before entering a feared situation.

**Obstacle:** I’m too busy. There never seems to be enough time to do the work.

**Solutions:** Put aside small blocks of time to be used exclusively for your social
anxiety exposure practices. If time is reserved just for this purpose, you
will be less likely to feel as if your practices are getting in the way of
your other important activities. This is something you want to do for
yourself. If you really want to deal with your social anxiety, you know
you can find the small blocks of time to reserve for the practices. Think
of practice times as taking a class. You may not always want to go to a
class, but if you want to learn what is being taught there, you find the
time to go.
Choose practices that can be completed during the course of your
regular routine. For example, you need to eat every day—you might as
well eat some of your meals with other people instead of always eating
alone.
Set aside a large block of time (e.g., clear a week-long vacation from
work) and spend the whole time practicing exposure nonstop.

**Obstacle:** I am not convinced that exposure practices will be helpful.

**Solutions:** Begin with a smaller exposure practice in which you have little to lose,
but in which you can still test whether exposing yourself to the situation
leads to a decrease in your fear.
The belief that exposure won’t work is probably just an example of a
negative thought that isn’t necessarily true. Examine the validity of your
beliefs regarding exposure. For example, can you think of reasons why
exposure may not have worked in the past? After you finish reading this
chapter, you may have some new ideas about how to ensure that expo-
sure will be more likely to work now.

**Obstacle:** My feared situations are difficult to create. For example, I can’t think of
any places to practice public speaking.

**Solutions:** Chapter 8 contains a large number of possible situations in which to prac-
tice exposure. Reading chapter 8 should help you to generate ideas.
Talk to family members and friends. They may be able to help you to
come up with some ideas for practices.

HOW TO CONDUCT EXPOSURE PRACTICES

This section provides suggestions for getting the most out of your exposure practices.
These include instructions for how to prepare for practices, suggestions to keep in mind
when planning practices, what to do during a particular practice, and what to do follow-
ing the practice. Some of the most important suggestions are summarized in a checklist
following this section.

Preparing for Exposure Practices

As much as possible, it’s important to plan your exposure practices in advance. As
discussed earlier, planning involves making decisions at the beginning of the week about
particular practices that you intend to try, as well as coming up with backup practices in
case your original plans don’t work out. It is very likely that planning will involve setting
aside specific times during which to practice. You should also have an idea of how a prac-
tice fits in with your short-term and long-term goals. For example, if your long-term goal
is to be able to give a presentation to a large group of coworkers, practicing speaking to
smaller groups may be an important step in your plan.
Before beginning any particular practice, we suggest that you make some very spe-
cific predictions about what might happen during the practice. Once you are aware of
your anxiety-provoking thoughts and predictions, use the cognitive strategies described
in chapter 6 to challenge your thoughts. Challenging your anxious thoughts before
entering into the situation will help you to manage your fear and discomfort.

Importance of Predictability and Control

As we discussed earlier, exposure works better if it is predictable and if you have a
sense of control over what’s happening in the situation. Therefore, it’s best to start with
exposure practices in which you have a pretty good idea of what is likely to happen.
Some situations, however, are inherently unpredictable. For example, if you decide to
ask another person out on a date, it may be impossible to know how the other person
will respond. In these cases, you can make the situation somewhat more predictable by
considering in advance all of the possible outcomes that could occur. For example, the
person might accept your invitation, turn it down, or put off responding for the time
being (for example, by not returning your call or saying, “I’m not sure, let me get back to
you”). The person may be warm or may come across as cold or uninterested. By antici-
pating as many outcomes as possible (as well as how you might cope with each outcome),
you will be less likely to be surprised.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Duration of Exposure

Exposure works better if it lasts long enough for you to learn that your feared
outcome doesn’t occur. We suggest that you try to stay in the situation for as long as
possible. For example, if you are at a party, try to stay for at least a couple of hours. If
you’re giving a presentation and have the option of making it longer, try to take advan-
tage of the opportunity to speak for a longer time. Ideally, you should stay in the situ-
ation until your anxiety decreases to a mild or moderate level. However, even if your
anxiety doesn’t decrease during a particular practice, exposure will still likely be helpful,
especially if you don’t leave the situation too quickly.
If you are practicing being in a situation that is naturally very brief (something like
asking a stranger for the time or directions), you can prolong the anxiety-provoking situ-
ation by repeating the exposure over and over for a longer period. For example, instead
of asking one person for information while walking through a shopping mall (“Where is
the food court?”), you can ask twenty or thirty different people for the same information
over the course of an hour or more. The chances are good that your fear will decrease
over time.

Frequency of Exposure

Exposure works better if practices are repeated close together. For example, giving a
speech once a week is more effective than giving a speech once a month. Daily speeches
will decrease your fear more effectively than once a week, even if the number of prac-
tices is the same. In other words, giving a presentation five days in a row will likely lead
to a greater decrease in fear than giving a presentation once per week for five consecu-
tive weeks. So, try to schedule practices as frequently as possible. We recommend that
you set aside at least an hour to practice exposure on most days. Once your fear has
begun to decrease considerably, it is a good idea to gradually spread out the practices
to every few weeks or even to every few months, depending on the situation and how
often it arises in your day-to-day life. Occasional practices will help to maintain the
improvements you have made in decreasing your fear.

Practice in a Variety of Situations

To some extent, working on decreasing your fear in a particular social or performance
situation will help you to feel more comfortable in other social situations as well. This
process is called _generalization_ , and research has shown that generalization often occurs
as a result of exposure. For example, if you learn to feel comfortable asking questions
in class, some of that success may “spread,” or generalize, to other situations, making it
easier for you to speak up at meetings at work. However, generalization will not cause
your success to spread to every situation you fear. Therefore, to get the most out of


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
exposure, it’s best to practice in a variety of different contexts, places, and situations.
For example, if you want to be more comfortable making small talk, we recommend that
you practice with your coworkers, family members, strangers in the elevator, at parties,
and in as many other situations as possible.

```
Choose Practices That Are Challenging but
Not Impossible
```
You may feel discouraged if while trying a particular practice, you become anxious
or uncomfortable. There is no need to feel discouraged. In fact, it is helpful for you to
feel some discomfort during exposure practices. That’s why you are doing the practices
in the first place. Over time, you will begin to feel less anxious. A successful practice is
one that you complete, regardless of how anxious you feel.
On the other hand, it’s not necessary to choose practices that are completely terrify-
ing or for which you find it impossible to stay in the situation. If a situation seems too
difficult, we encourage you to try something easier. But do try something.

Choose Practices with Minimal Risk

Choose practices in which the likely consequences are minimal, except for a period
of feeling anxious. For example, if you want to be more comfortable with the possibility
of seeming foolish or being the center of attention, there are lots of safe practices that
you can try (for example, walking around with your shirt inside out, telling the cashier
that you have forgotten your wallet when you reach the front of the grocery line). There
is no need to take unnecessary risks, such as telling your boss what a jerk he is or yelling
out a dirty joke at your best friend’s wedding. If you’re not sure about the realistic risks
associated with a particular practice, ask someone whose judgment you trust (perhaps a
friend or family member).

Measure Your Improvement

It will be helpful to assess your anxiety from time to time using the forms and sugges-
tions in chapter 3. Evaluating your improvement periodically will remind you of how far
you have come and will also let you know when it is time to move on to new situations.

Include a Helper or Coach

Consider including a friend, coworker, or therapist to act as a coach during exposure
practices. This individual can help you with role-play practices (for instance, a mock


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

job interview, practicing making small talk) and can provide you with feedback follow-
ing your practices. If you choose to include a helper during some exposure exercises,
that person should be familiar with the basic principles of exposure. Either you should
instruct the person about what their role as helper or coach entails, or you should have
the person read the relevant sections of this book. In fact, some combination of both
approaches may work best. In addition, the person you choose to work with should be
supportive and unlikely to become frustrated if things don’t work out as planned.

Keep Your Expectations Realistic

Don’t expect your anxiety to change overnight. It will likely take weeks or months
for it to improve. Also, you won’t be able to follow your improvement like a straight line
on a graph. You may find that in some situations your anxiety decreases fairly quickly,
whereas in other situations success takes longer. Also, you may find that some exposure
practices don’t lead to any improvement in your fear. You may even have weeks during
which your fear and anxiety worsen. A good rule of thumb is to expect one step back
for every two or three steps forward.

Don’t Fight Your Feelings

For years, you have probably been trying to control your anxiety, to prevent it from
occurring, and to get rid of it as soon as possible—no matter what the cost. By now,
you have probably discovered that trying to control your emotions doesn’t work. In fact,
attempts to control your anxiety are likely to make it worse rather than better. Fighting
your fear is like lying in bed trying hard to fall asleep by a particular time, telling your-
self, “I must fall asleep!” Often, the more you try to sleep, the harder it becomes. In fact,
for some people who have trouble sleeping, trying to stay awake is a productive strategy.
As soon as they stop _trying_ to sleep, they fall asleep quite quickly.
When you can allow yourself to become anxious without fighting the feelings, even-
tually you will become much more comfortable in social and performance situations.
This sounds contradictory, but it really works this way. Instead of fighting your feelings,
just let them happen. Instead of evaluating your experiences (for example, “sweating in
front of others is unacceptable”), accept them. When practicing exposure, you should
observe your responses and experiences without evaluating them. Your fear will likely
pass more quickly if you are not trying so hard to get rid of it. Remember, the worst
thing that can happen is that you will feel uncomfortable for a while. Being anxious is
not dangerous, and anxiety always passes.
As reviewed in chapter 4, variations of cognitive behavioral therapy have recently
been developed that emphasize the importance of accepting one’s experiences rather
than trying to change them. Examples include mindfulness meditation and a form of psy-
chotherapy called acceptance and commitment therapy (Hayes and Smith 2005). These


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
treatments have been found to be effective for treating certain types of anxiety prob-
lems, as well as for preventing depression from returning in people who have recently
overcome an episode of depression (Eifert and Forsyth 2005; Orsillo and Roemer 2005;
Williams et al. 2007). Learning to accept your uncomfortable feelings rather than fight
them will ultimately help you to feel more comfortable in the situations you fear.

Eliminate Subtle Avoidance Behaviors

As discussed earlier in this chapter, it is important that you stop the subtle avoidance
strategies you use to feel safer in social and performance situations. For example, if you
tend to sit on your hands so people won’t notice them shaking, try letting your hands
show. If you avoid talking about yourself when conversing with others, purposely try to
talk about your own interests and opinions. For example, mention a book that you’ve
recently read or a movie that you’ve seen, and share your opinions. If it’s a best seller
or a big hit, and you liked it, try to convey your enthusiasm to the person with whom
you’re talking; if you didn’t like it, don’t hide your opinion. Express yourself and take a
chance on engaging in an exciting dialogue.
Eliminating safety behaviors such as overpreparing for presentations, drinking
alcohol at parties, and wearing makeup to hide blushing will help you to learn that social
situations can be managed, even without using these strategies and behaviors.

Ending a Practice and Moving On to the Next One

Ideally, an exposure practice should not end before your fear has decreased to a mild
or moderate level (such as 20 to 40 on a 0- to 100-point scale). Sometimes, this will take
a few minutes; other times, it may take several hours. If possible, try to stay in the situa-
tion until you feel more comfortable. However, even if your fear doesn’t decrease within
a practice, you will still likely benefit from the practice over the long term.
In reality, you may not always have control over when an exposure practice ends. For
example, if you’re practicing eating lunch with coworkers during a half-hour lunch break,
you may not have the option of stretching the lunch into two hours just to give your
anxiety a chance to decrease. If the situation ends before your anxiety has decreased, try
to practice the same situation again as soon as possible. Continue to repeat the practice
until it becomes easier. At that point, you can move on to another practice.

Using Exposure Records and Diaries

To get the most out of your exposure practices, we suggest that you use the diaries
and forms provided in chapters 8 and 9 to monitor your progress.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

The Aftermath of Exposure: Processing What Happened

Chances are that you will feel good following your exposure practices. Although
you may be tired, you likely will also feel relieved to have completed the practice and
proud of your accomplishments. Nevertheless, some people tend to analyze their every
move and criticize their performances during the practice (for example, “People surely
noticed my anxiety,” “I came across like a bumbling idiot”). If you tend to dwell on what
happened during your practices, we suggest that you try to put a more positive spin on
the experience.
Remember that the main reason you are practicing exposure is to _eventually_ feel
more comfortable in social and performance situations. However, for now, expect to
feel uncomfortable during practices. Expect that your performance won’t be perfect (in
fact, the goal isn’t perfection anyway). Rather than dwelling on what happened or didn’t
happen, try to use the cognitive techniques from chapter 6 to challenge your negative
thinking. Also, try to take something positive from the experience. Even if things didn’t
go the way you had hoped they would, you can still use the experience to plan future
practices and to generate ideas for what you might do differently the next time.

A WORD TO SIGNIFICANT OTHERS, FRIENDS,

AND FAMILY MEMBERS

If you are reading this book in order to help a loved one, here are a few suggestions to
keep in mind. First, your loved one must be on board with this treatment. Treatment is
not something that can be forced on someone who isn’t willing to make the necessary
changes. In addition, you should avoid the temptation to trick, force, bribe, or coerce
a person into doing exposure practices. In order to get the most out of treatment, it’s
important that the decision to do exposure comes from the individual.
Your role in exposure therapy is to help brainstorm possible exposure practices,
to provide support, to participate in exposure role-plays (for example, a simulated job
interview), and to be involved in actual exposure practices when you’re asked to do so.
For example, if your loved one fears attending parties, he may ask you to attend a party
with him. If your loved one fears eating in restaurants, she may ask you to join her for
a meal. In advance of any exposure practices, discuss with your loved one what he or
she would like you to do in the situation (for example, provide reassurance, provide
company, probe for anxiety-provoking thoughts, and so on).

TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** My fear does not decrease during my exposure practices.

**Solutions:** This is normal to some extent. Although anxiety and fear usually decrease
during the course of a particular exposure practice, most people experi-
ence occasional practices in which their anxiety doesn’t decrease. Here
are some suggestions for dealing with this situation.
Make sure that you are staying in the situation long enough. Sometimes
it can take several hours for a person’s fear to diminish.
Make sure that you are not using subtle avoidance strategies. The
normal pattern during exposure is for fear to increase and then gradu-
ally to decrease. Using subtle avoidance strategies such as distraction


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
may cause the fear to go up and down repeatedly over the course of the
practice, because most people are not very good at distracting them-
selves for long periods.
Negative thinking can sometimes interfere with the effects of exposure.
If your fear does not decrease during a particular exposure practice,
challenge your anxious thoughts using the techniques described in
chapter 6.
If all else fails, just keep practicing. Sometimes it takes repeated expo-
sure practices before a person’s fear begins to lessen.
```
**Problem:** My fear returns between exposure practices.

**Solution:** This is normal for most people. With more and more practice, your
fear will decrease more quickly during practices and will not return as
intensely between them. One way of preventing your fear from return-
ing between exposures is to increase the frequency of your practices,
particularly early in treatment.

**Problem:** My physical symptoms (for instance, stuttering, shaking, sweating) are
very noticeable.

**Solution:** Remember that, despite how it seems to you, the chances are good that
your symptoms are not as noticeable to others as you think they are.
Furthermore, as your anxiety decreases, the intensity of these symp-
toms will likely decrease. If you are concerned about people noticing
your symptoms, use the cognitive techniques from chapter 6 to chal-
lenge your anxious thinking. Remember that there are lots of people
who blush, shake, or lose their train of thought and who couldn’t care
less about what other people think. The problem is not that you experi-
ence these symptoms, but rather your beliefs about the consequences
of having these symptoms.

**Problem:** I am just not good at (making small talk,
public speaking, and so on).

**Solution:** Your social skills are likely much better than you think they are. As
discussed in earlier chapters, people who are socially anxious tend to be
overly critical of their social and performance skills. Nevertheless, there
may be ways in which certain skills can be improved. It is likely that
exposure alone will contribute to an improvement of your skills. For
example, practicing making small talk will help you to learn what works
during a casual conversation and what doesn’t. In addition, we suggest
that you read chapter 10, which includes specific strategies for improv-
ing social and communication skills.


```
Confronting Your Fears Through Exposure
```
**Problem:** My fear is too high to benefit from exposure.

**Solutions:** Ideally, you should choose practices that arouse a fear level of 70 to
80 out of 100, although it is also okay if your fear reaches even higher
levels. One method for keeping your fear in check is to use the cog-
nitive strategies from chapter 6 to challenge your anxious thoughts
before entering the situation. At times, however, even using the cogni-
tive techniques beforehand won’t prevent your fear from becoming very
intense.
If you find that your fear is completely overwhelming, you have three
options. First, you can try to wait a while longer to see if your fear
decreases. Alternatively, you may consider taking a short break and
then trying the same exercise again. Finally, you can try switching to a
less difficult practice. Any of these approaches is usually fine. The main
point is not to give up completely.

**Problem:** The situations that I fear are very brief in duration, so there isn’t enough
time for my fear to decrease.

**Solution:** This issue was discussed earlier in the chapter, but it’s worth highlight-
ing again here. Ideally, if an exposure practice is brief, you should try
to find creative ways to lengthen the duration of the practice, if pos-
sible. For example, if you are fearful of chatting with the cashier at the
front of a supermarket line, try lining up repeatedly over the course of
an hour or two and buying only a few items at a time. This approach
will give you more opportunities to talk to the cashiers, compared with
paying for all your groceries at once.

**Problem:** I just had something terrible happen during an exposure practice (for
example, my boss criticized my presentation). How can I ever try expo-
sure again?

**Solutions:** Although rare, it is possible that an unexpected negative event will
occur during an exposure practice. For example, you could experience
a bad panic attack during a job interview, or you may be laughed at
during a presentation. If something bad does happen during an expo-
sure practice, it’s natural for some of your fear to return. It may be
helpful to “rethink” the meaning of the negative event using the cogni-
tive techniques described in chapter 6. In addition, we recommend that
you resume your exposure practices. If necessary, you can return to a
previous item in your hierarchy and work your way back to where you
were when the unfortunate incident took place.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

**Problem:** I don’t avoid the situation, and yet my fear persists.

**Solutions:** Although exposure usually leads to a decrease in fear, occasionally
people report having intense fear in social situations despite almost
never avoiding these situations. For example, a person may eat with
others on a regular basis but still get anxious in the situation. If you
continue to experience fear, despite never avoiding the feared situation,
you may find it difficult to come up with appropriate exposure exercises.
Here are three strategies to consider.
First, if you fear experiencing arousal symptoms while in social situa-
tions, try the interoceptive exposure exercises discussed in chapter 9.
Second, assess whether you are engaging in subtle avoidance strategies,
overprotective behaviors, alcohol or drug use, or other strategies that
may be undermining the effects of the exposure. If so, try to discontinue
these behaviors. Finally, a special effort should be used to identify and
challenge the anxious predictions and beliefs that continue to maintain
your fear (see chapter 6).


CHAPTER 8

### Exposure to Social Situations

In chapter 7, we provided an overview of the basic principles underlying exposure-based
treatments for social anxiety. In this chapter, we’ll present additional information about
how to use these strategies to confront the social and performance situations that make
you anxious or uncomfortable. You should be very familiar with the material in chapter
7 before moving on to this chapter. As noted earlier, we suggest that you use the cogni-
tive strategies described in chapter 6 to combat anxious thinking before, during, and
after exposure practices. During practices, you should refrain from using subtle avoid-
ance techniques such as distraction, drugs or alcohol, and safety behaviors (for example,
eating in a dimly lit restaurant so people don’t notice your blushing). Finally, a reminder
that exposure works best when practices are:

```
UÊ Frequent (daily, if possible)
```
```
UÊ Prolonged (until the anxiety decreases)
```
```
UÊ Predictable and controllable
```
```
UÊ Planned in advance
```
```
UÊ Conducted in a variety of different situations
```
SITUATIONAL EXPOSURE PRACTICES

This section provides suggestions for exposure practices involving different types of
social and performance situations, including public speaking, making small talk, meeting
new friends and dating, situations involving conflict with others, being the center of


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

attention, eating and drinking in public, writing in front of others, job interviews, being
in public, and talking to people in authority. In addition to the suggestions provided
here, there is space in each section for you to record additional ideas for practices that
might be relevant to your own social and performance anxiety.
At first, many of the items suggested in this section may seem overwhelming.
However, as suggested in chapter 7, you should begin with challenging but manageable
practices. Over time, you will become more comfortable and most likely you will be able
to try some of the more difficult practices. In addition, some of these practices may seem
very easy to you. If you have no trouble with a particular type of social or performance
situation, there is no need to practice confronting it. Instead, focus on the situations that
are anxiety-provoking for you.

Practices Involving Public Speaking

To overcome a fear of speaking in front of others, it is helpful to take advantage of
opportunities that come up during the course of your job or other activities in your day-
to-day life. If public speaking opportunities don’t normally arise in your life, there are
many ways of creating these situations. Some of these include the following:

```
UÊ Speak up in meetings at work. For example, share your opinions about
issues being discussed. Ask and answer questions. If the opportunity to
make a brief presentation arises, take advantage of it.
```
```
UÊ Offer to give a presentation at work or in another situation. For example,
if you belong to a book club or reading group, offer to present a summary
of the book that your group is reading. If you have some special expertise,
offer to share it with your coworkers, colleagues, or friends by giving a
formal presentation.
```
```
UÊ Go to a public lecture and ask questions. Public lectures are often adver-
tised in the newspaper, on the Internet, on the radio, or on television (for
example, on your local cable access channel). Also, check out advertisements
on community bulletin boards and posters at the library, supermarket, local
colleges, or other public places.
```
```
UÊ Take a course at a college, university, or any school that offers adult
education courses. Try to choose courses that provide the opportunity to
give presentations. If these are not available, make a point of asking ques-
tions several times during each class. If you are unable to enroll in a course,
another option is to simply audit or sit in on a large class at a local univer-
sity. Professors will sometimes give guests permission to observe a class
without formally enrolling. Often, undergraduate classes contain hundreds
of students, so no one would notice an extra person in the room. Auditing
```

```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
```
a large class will save you from having to pay registration fees while still
providing you with an opportunity to ask questions in public.
```
**UÊ Make an impromptu speech or toast at a wedding, party, group dinner,
or other social gathering**. If you are invited to a party or are planning to
have a party of your own, offer to make a short speech in front of the other
guests.

**UÊ Take a public speaking course**. There are numerous companies that offer
public speaking courses (especially for businesspeople). These classes are
sometimes expensive, but it may be worth finding out more about the avail-
able options (perhaps your workplace would help to cover the costs). Check
the Internet or your local Yellow Pages to learn about courses. There are
many options available, including, for example, courses by Dale Carnegie
Training (www.dalecarnegie.com) and The Leader’s Institute (www.leaders
institute.com).

**UÊ Join Toastmasters International**. Toastmasters is an organization that holds
meetings for individuals who are interested in learning to speak more effec-
tively in front of others. They have more than 11,000 clubs located in ninety
countries around the world. Typically, groups include about twenty indi-
viduals who meet for one to two hours each week. Annual membership is
inexpensive. For more information, visit [http://www.toastmasters.org.](http://www.toastmasters.org.)

**UÊ Take a drama or music class**. Taking a theater, drama, or music class will
provide you with opportunities to perform in front of others. Classes may
be available at local high schools or colleges, professional theater or music
schools, the YMCA, or through other agencies.

**UÊ Give a lecture at a local elementary school, high school, or college about
your work**. Sometimes schools will hold career days through which students
have opportunities to learn about particular jobs or careers. Additionally,
teachers sometimes invite guests to speak to their classes about particu-
lar types of careers or jobs. Call a local school principal to find out about
opportunities in your neighborhood school. Or, if you have a child in school,
you may have the opportunity to speak to his or her class about what you
do at work.

**UÊ Read a passage in front of others**. For some people, reading a newspaper
article or a passage from a book in front of a few family members may
be anxiety provoking. For others, it may be important to try something
more challenging, such as reading an introduction for a guest speaker who
is about to give a presentation at your workplace.

Now, can you think of other possible practices that involve public speaking? If so,
record them in the space below:

**Other Practices**

```
Practices Involving Making Small Talk, Casual
Conversation, and Informal Socializing
```
Casual conversation and small talk can take place anywhere. The list below provides
a few examples of situations where you might have the opportunity to practice these
skills. In addition to planning several large practices per week, you should try to engage
in several mini-practices throughout the day.

```
UÊ Have friends over for a get-together. For example, invite several cowork-
ers over for dinner or to watch a movie or sports event on TV. Or, have a
birthday party for a friend or family member. Make sure that you interact
with your guests! Don’t come up with excuses to avoid them (like serving
food and drinks to the exclusion of conversation, cleaning up, or washing
the dishes).
```
```
UÊ Speak to strangers on elevators, while waiting in lines, at bus stops, or
at other public locations. With repeated practice, making small talk will
become easier. Prolonged exposure works best, so try to talk to many dif-
ferent people over the course of an hour or two to get the most benefit.
Smile, say hello, and use humor, if appropriate. Although you should be
prepared for some people to react negatively (remember, other people may
also be shy or they may be uninterested in making small talk), most people
will probably react positively.
```
```
UÊ Ask for directions or for the time. Walk up to a stranger in a mall or store
and ask what time it is. Or, ask how to find a particular location. As men-
tioned earlier, prolonged exposure works best, so try to do this repeatedly
over an hour or two or until your anxiety decreases.
```
```
UÊ Talk to coworkers or classmates. Try arriving at school or work a bit early
so that you will have the opportunity to chat with others. Make a point of
saying hello to your coworkers or classmates during breaks. Simple ques-
tions such as, “How was your weekend?” are often a great way to get a
conversation started.
```

```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
**UÊ Talk to dog owners who are walking their dogs**. Dog owners often love to
talk about their dogs. If you have a dog, try going for walks in areas where
other people walk their pets. Make comments or ask questions about other
people’s dogs (for example, “Nice dog” or “What kind of dog is that?”). If
you return to the same routes frequently, you will likely see the same people
over and over again. You may even make some new friends.

**UÊ Talk to cashiers or other staff personnel in stores**. For example, comment
on the weather, ask for advice or information (“Does this shirt go with these
pants?”), or special order a book or CD.

**UÊ Give or receive compliments**. Offer someone else a compliment. For
example, tell a coworker that you like her sweater or new haircut, tell an
artist that you like his work, or compliment a waiter on the quality of your
food. If you are uncomfortable receiving compliments, just say “Thank you”
when someone praises you. Don’t discount the praise by telling the person
all the reasons why you don’t deserve it.

**UÊ Express a controversial opinion**. If you have a controversial opinion about
some issue, express it, particularly in situations where the consequences are
likely to be minimal. For example, if you didn’t like a movie that someone
else is raving about, let them know what you didn’t like about the film. If
you disagree with someone else’s political views, explain your perspective
on the issue. Try not to put down the other person or to discount that
person’s views when you are expressing your own opinions. Differing views
should be expressed in a friendly and supportive way, and you should make
an effort to communicate understanding of the other person’s perspective.

**UÊ Join an ongoing conversation**. In some circumstances, it is perfectly appro-
priate to join an ongoing conversation. For example, at parties people often
walk about, moving in and out of different conversations. See if you can join
in with a group of people who are discussing some issue that interests you.

**UÊ Talk to parents of other children**. Just as pet owners enjoy talking to other
pet owners, parents usually enjoy talking about their children with other
parents. If you have children, get involved in situations where you might
have the opportunity to talk to other parents. For example, attend parents’
night at your children’s school or enroll your children in a class (such as
swimming, hockey, crafts, music) with other children. Take advantage of any
opportunities to talk to the other parents.

**UÊ Meet two or three friends at a café**. Invite several coworkers or friends to
meet you after work or school for a coffee, drink, or snack. Alternatively,
invite others to join you for lunch.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Can you think of other possible practices that involve informal socializing, casual
conversation, or making small talk? If so, record them in the space below:

**Other Practices**

Practices Involving Meeting New Friends and Dating

Many of the situations listed in the previous section on practices involving small
talk and casual conversation also provide opportunities to meet new people. Similarly,
several of the situations listed in this section also provide opportunities for casual con-
versation. Most new friendships and relationships start with a casual conversation, so it’s
no surprise that these sections might overlap. Also, developing new relationships often
requires repeated encounters with new people you meet. In other words, two people
will typically become acquaintances before they become friends. The list below provides
examples of practices that involve a possibility of meeting new people, developing new
friendships, developing new business relationships, or fostering opportunities for dating.
Remember that the main goal of an exposure practice should be to become more com-
fortable in these situations. For now, developing new relationships should be a secondary
goal. Focus on the process of reducing your fear rather than whether you develop new
friends or relationships through these practices.

```
UÊ Go to a social event. For example, attend your annual office holiday party,
a class reunion, a community dance, a local art gallery opening, or a book
signing. Situations such as these will provide you with opportunities to meet
people, as well as to mingle and make small talk. Be sure to take social risks
in these situations (for example, talking to other people).
```
```
UÊ Talk to your neighbors. Go for walks in the neighborhood and say hello
to your neighbors—particularly those you have not had a chance to meet.
If you have a new neighbor, consider asking him or her over for a drink or
dessert. Invite some of your other neighbors as well.
```
```
UÊ Join a club, take a class, or join an organization. For example, join a bowling
league, aerobics class, volleyball league, bingo group, self-help group, church
group, art class, or other group. Ideally, the group should meet frequently
(for instance, weekly) for you to get the most benefit from attending it.
```

```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
```
UÊ Ask friends or colleagues to introduce you to new people. Take advantage
of opportunities to meet new people through friends, coworkers, or other
people you know.
```
```
UÊ Invite people you know to socialize. For example, invite several coworkers
or acquaintances for lunch, dinner, a movie, or a concert. Or, invite several
coworkers or acquaintances away on a vacation, ski weekend, or conference-
related trip.
```
```
UÊ Meet people through online social networks or dating services. Consider
joining an online social networking site, such as Facebook (www.facebook
.com) or MySpace (www.myspace.com). Join online chat rooms. Meet
people through online dating services (for example, http://www.match.com). Two
cautions: first, although the Internet can be a useful tool for meeting people,
it’s important that you not rely exclusively on online relationships instead
of in-person relationships. Rather, consider using the Internet as a tool for
meeting people who you might eventually meet in person. Second, if you
are meeting people in person for the first time, use appropriate caution. For
example, a first date should happen in a public place, and you should not
give others your home address until you know them fairly well.
```
```
UÊ Arrange for dates through personal ads or dating services. In addition
to meeting people through the Internet, you can also find opportunities
for dating through professional dating services and through personal ads in
local newspapers.
```
Can you think of other possible practices that involve meeting new friends, dating,
or related situations? If so, record them in the space below:

**Other Practices**

Practices Involving Possible Conflict with Others

These practices should be planned carefully. Unlike the other practices recom-
mended in this chapter, these are likely to cause another person to become a bit angry
or impatient with your behavior. Choose practices in which the risks are minimal—if you
are unsure of the risks, ask a friend or family member for a second opinion. You may also


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

want to skip ahead to the sections on assertive communication in chapter 10 to prepare
yourself for this kind of interaction. It’s important that potential conflict situations be
dealt with assertively rather than with aggression, which is likely to escalate the other
person’s anger.
It may seem rude to do things purposefully that will inconvenience others. On the
other hand, as you continue to read this section, you will see that most of these practices
involve only minor inconvenience to other people, and many of these are situations that
people often encounter anyway. The substantial gains that you may obtain from these
practices are likely to outweigh any inconvenience that you create for others.
Listed below are some examples of practices that others have found useful for
becoming more comfortable with conflict situations:

```
UÊ Ask someone else to change his or her behavior. For example, ask your
roommate to wash his or her dishes rather than leaving dirty dishes lying
around. Or, ask another person to stop talking in a movie theater.
```
```
UÊ Stay stopped in your car for a few seconds when the light turns green.
Pretend you are changing the radio station or that you didn’t notice the
light turn green. The drivers who are backed up behind you eventually may
become frustrated and honk their horns. This should be your signal to drive
away.
```
```
UÊ Say no when you don’t want to do something. If someone asks you to do
something that you don’t want to do (for example, donate money that you
can’t afford, purchase an item from a telemarketer, do more than your fair
share of work, and so on), say no in an assertive (though polite) way. Again,
we recommend that you read chapter 10 for suggestions regarding assertive
communication.
```
```
UÊ Return an item to a store. Return a book, an article of clothing, or some
other item to a store. In most cases, the staff at the store will gladly take
back the item. However, sometimes you may encounter a negative response,
which will provide you with the opportunity to get used to this uncom-
fortable situation. To really test yourself, try to return an item without
a receipt, without the original packaging, or after the allowed period for
returns has passed. The store may not take back the item, but you will get
an opportunity to practice dealing with possible conflict.
```
```
UÊ Send food back in a restaurant. Ask your server to take your food back (for
instance, to change the dressing on your salad, make your soup hotter, cook
your food more thoroughly, or bring you a different drink).
```
```
UÊ Take an extra long time at a bank machine when there are people waiting
behind you. For example, make several deposits, transfer funds from one
```

```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
```
account to another, and withdraw cash from two or more different accounts.
Make eye contact with others in line to see if they are looking impatient.
```
```
UÊ F orget your money when paying for an item in a store. For example, when
you reach the front of a supermarket line, tell the cashier that you have
forgotten your wallet. Or, have more items in your cart than you can afford
to purchase. This will help you to better tolerate the possibility of inconve-
niencing the cashier and the people in line behind you.
```
```
UÊ Ask a stranger to stop smoking. If you are in a restaurant or bar, or even in
a public place outdoors, try asking the person next to you to stop smoking.
Use some discretion. For example, don’t practice this if the other person
seems aggressive, likely to get angry, or is much bigger than you are.

flict? If so, record them in the space below:

**Other Practices**

Practices Involving Being the Center of Attention

Here are some suggestions for ways to draw attention to yourself. If you are afraid
of looking foolish, standing out in a crowd, or simply being observed by others, try some
of these exercises:

```
UÊ Say something incorrectly. Purposefully answer a question incorrectly in class,
provide someone with incorrect information, or mispronounce a word.
```
```
UÊ Speak loudly. Speak loudly in a public place (for example, at a mall, in a bus,
or on the subway), so that others around you can hear your conversation.
```
```
UÊ Have a mobile phone or pager go off in a public place. Arrange for someone
to page you or call you on your cell phone while you are at the dentist, eating
at a restaurant, or walking through a public place. Use some discretion here.
For example, don’t try this practice during a college exam, a job interview, or
while at a movie, unless your intention is to annoy the people around you.
```
```
UÊ Drop something. Drop your keys, your books, or some other item in a
public place. Or, spill water all over your shirt.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Talk about yourself. When speaking with other people, talk about your
family, your job, your hobbies, or some other aspect of your personal life.
Offer your opinions about political issues, books that you have read recently,
or movies that you have seen.
```
```
UÊ Participate in a party game. For example, play Twister, Pictionary,
Scattergories, Outburst, Trivial Pursuit, or some other game with friends,
coworkers, or your family.
```
```
UÊ Wear your shirt or dress inside out or backward. Walk around a public
place while making a fashion faux pas. The more outrageous, the better.
For example, wear shoes that don’t match. Wear a plaid shirt with striped
pants. Wear your dress or shirt inside out (this exercise is even better if your
dress or shirt has shoulder pads), or wear a formal evening gown during the
day. With practice, you will become much less concerned about looking
conspicuous.
```
```
UÊ Knock over a display in a store. For example, knock over a few rolls of
paper towels or toilet paper in the supermarket. Again, it is important to use
good judgment. For example, don’t knock over glass jars of tomato sauce.
That would be going too far!

Practices Involving Eating or Drinking with Others

People who fear drinking in front of others are often concerned about having shaky
hands and spilling their drinks. Those who are fearful of eating in front of others may be
nervous about making a mess, looking unattractive while eating, or feeling flushed from
eating hot foods. You should choose to practice exposure in situations that will challenge
your specific anxieties. For example, if you are more anxious when eating messy foods,
you should order foods that are more likely to be messy. If you’re nervous about blushing
or sweating, order hot soup or a spicy meal. A list of situations offering an opportunity
to eat or drink in front of others is provided here:


```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
```
UÊ Eat a snack at your desk. If your desk at work is in an open area, eat a snack
at your desk. This may be easier than eating with your coworkers. When
this exercise becomes easier, you can move to other practices, such as those
in the rest of this list.
```
```
UÊ Hold a drink at a party or gathering. If you tend to be anxious when holding
a glass of wine or a soft drink in front of others, try doing just that the next
time you’re at a party or other social gathering. Try not to hide your hands
if they begin to shake. If alcohol tends to decrease your anxiety, make sure
you don’t drink wine, beer, or spirits until after your anxiety has decreased
on its own.
```
```
UÊ Have lunch with coworkers. You probably eat lunch every day. You might
as well eat with other people, if the opportunity arises. If your natural ten-
dency is to eat at your desk or to eat lunch in restaurants alone, invite a
coworker to join you for lunch once or twice every week.
```
```
UÊ Meet a friend at a restaurant for dinner. If you tend to feel safer in dark
restaurants, challenge yourself by choosing a more brightly lit location. Try
to choose a seat where you are more likely to be observed by the other
people in the restaurant.
```
```
UÊ I nvite people over for a meal. For example, invite two or three friends or
neighbors over for dinner.
```
```
UÊ Dine at other people’s homes. If you tend to decline invitations to eat at
other people’s homes, accept the invitation next time. You may find it more
difficult to do so if you are concerned about not being able to control the
environment (such as the lighting), who the other guests are, and what types
of food are served, but don’t use these as reasons to avoid the situation.
```
```
UÊ Dine alone in a restaurant, food court, or another public place. If eating
alone in public makes you anxious, having lunch alone in a restaurant or
food court is an appropriate practice. You might also want to consider eating
in other public places, such as sitting on a bench in a park or in a shopping
mall.

Practices Involving Writing in Front of Others

As a rule, people who are uncomfortable writing in front of others are concerned
about having shaky hands while they are writing. They also may be fearful of others
judging their handwriting or noticing personal information that they may be record-
ing. Examples of situations that can provide an opportunity to write in front of others
include the following:

```
UÊ Pay for items using a check. Instead of paying with cash or a debit card,
write a check when purchasing merchandise in a store. Be sure to complete
the check in front of the cashier (don’t write out the check before you get
to the store: that’s cheating). If you’re concerned about having the cashier
notice your shaky hands, try making your hands shake purposefully. In fact,
to really challenge your fear, let your hands shake so much that you have to
write a whole new check.
```
```
UÊ Write a letter while seated in a public place. Write a letter to a friend while
sitting in a café, riding on a bus, or relaxing on a public bench. Make sure
that there are others around who can see you writing.
```
```
UÊ Fill out forms or applications in front of other people. For example, com-
plete an application for a new credit card or loan at a bank (with the bank
officer watching), complete an application for a new video-store member-
ship, fill out a contest ballot in front of a cashier, or sign documents in front
of your coworkers.

To become more comfortable with job interviews, the best exposure practices are
those that provide experiences similar to real job interviews. Some examples include:

UÊ Apply for a volunteer position. Many volunteer opportunities (for example,
in hospitals, schools, theater companies, charitable organizations, community

Exposure to Social Situations

agencies, and so on) begin with an interview process that is very similar to
an interview for a paying job. You may feel less pressure if you know that
you’re applying for a nonpaying position. If so, this would be a good place
to start. In addition to giving the employer the opportunity to meet you,
another purpose of an interview is to give you a chance to evaluate the posi-
tion. Applying for a volunteer position does not commit you to accepting it
if it’s offered. If you decide it isn’t for you, you can always turn it down. If
you apply for several volunteer jobs, you will become more comfortable with
the entire interview process.
```
```
UÊ Practice interviews with family members or friends. Practicing job inter-
views with friends or family members is another good way to begin the
process of overcoming anxiety over job interviews. You will need to coach
your friend or family member about the nature of the interview and the role
that he or she should take. You may also want to work up to having some
of these role-play interviews become particularly challenging (for example,
have your helper play the role of a hostile interviewer), so you can learn to
be more comfortable with difficult interviews in real life.
```
```
UÊ Apply for jobs that are not particularly interesting to you. A great way of
learning to overcome a fear of job interviews is to practice interviewing for
jobs that are not high on your list. You might as well learn how to interview
more effectively in situations in which you have little to lose. By practicing
interviewing for jobs you don’t particularly want, you will be better pre-
pared when it comes time to interview for a job that interests you.
```
```
UÊ Apply for jobs that interest you. If you are looking for a new job, eventu-
ally you must be able to interview for the job you want. The more jobs you
apply for, the more interviews you will be offered. The more interviews that
you get, the more opportunities you will have to practice your interviewing
skills and to overcome your fear of being interviewed. Although it’s reason-
able to start the process by interviewing for jobs that are not particularly
interesting to you, you should also be applying for jobs that you might really
be interested in accepting.

Practices Involving Being in Public

For some people, just being around other people is anxiety provoking, even if there
is no interaction or direct social contact. If being in a public place is difficult for you,
here are some examples of public places where you may be able to practice exposure.
Remember to practice frequently and to stay long enough for your fear to decrease. If
you must leave the situation, try to return to it as soon as possible.

```
UÊ Go to a mall or supermarket. Shopping is a good way of exposing yourself
to other people in a public place. Try shopping when the stores are more
crowded to challenge your fearful thoughts even more.
```
```
UÊ Make eye contact in a public place. If appropriate, make eye contact with
other people while you walk down the street or while sitting on a bus or
subway. Of course, for safety reasons, this may not be wise in some cities,
particularly at night, or in dangerous parts of town.
```
```
UÊ Go to a concert or sporting event. A guaranteed place to encounter lots
of other people is at a large concert, sporting event, movie theater, or other
entertainment venue. If you prefer to sit in an aisle seat or near the exit (for
a quick escape), try sitting in the middle of the row and away from the exit.
```
```
UÊ Read in a public place. Spend some time reading your favorite book, a
newspaper, or a new novel at a coffee shop or library.
```
```
UÊ Join a gym or take an aerobics class. Rather than exercising alone, practice
exercising in front of others. For example, join an aerobics class and take a
spot near the front of the room. Or, lift weights near other people who are
more experienced and stronger than you are.

figures. Examples of relevant exposure practices are listed below. If any of these are
situations in which you would like to feel more comfortable, they may be appropriate
practices for you to try.

UÊ Have a meeting with your boss or teacher. If you are a student, ask your
teacher to meet with you to discuss a difficult homework assignment. If you
are working, ask your boss for an appointment to discuss your performance
or some other aspect of your job.
```
```
UÊ Ask a pharmacist questions about a medication. If you are taking any medi-
cations, ask a pharmacist to answer particular questions about the medica-
tion (for example, side effects, interactions with other medications, how to
get refills, and so on). If you’re not taking any medications, you can still ask
questions, perhaps on behalf of a friend or family member.
```
```
UÊ Ask your doctor to explain a particular medical issue. Make an appoint-
ment with your family doctor to ask questions about symptoms that you
may be experiencing. Be sure to have your questions answered.
```
```
UÊ Meet with your bank manager. For example, arrange to meet with your
bank’s manager or loan officer to discuss the possibility of obtaining a loan
or mortgage.
```
```
UÊ Meet with a lawyer. For example, meet with a lawyer to discuss estate plan-
ning (writing a will) or some other legal issue that you are dealing with.
```
```
UÊ Meet with an accountant or financial advisor. Hire an accountant with
whom you feel intimidated to do your taxes, or meet with an intimidating
financial advisor to get investment advice.

CHALLENGING YOUR WORST FEARS

By repeatedly exposing yourself to anxiety-provoking situations, you will continue to
challenge most of your deeply held beliefs and predictions concerning your ability


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

to cope with social and performance situations. Ideally, exposure practices should be
designed to test the validity of your anxious assumptions. For example, if you are fearful
of saying something foolish during a conversation at a party, it’s not enough simply to
attend parties, although just attending may be a reasonable first step. To more thor-
oughly challenge such an anxiety-provoking belief, you also would need to talk to other
people at the party. By having numerous conversations with others, eventually you will
learn that most of what you say is not foolish at all.
After reaching a certain level of comfort talking to other people at parties, the next
step might be to practice saying something silly or foolish purposefully and to evalu-
ate the consequences. This exercise would help to challenge your anxious beliefs at an
even deeper level. Chances are that even if you did say something foolish at a party, the
consequences would be minimal. With this type of exposure practice, you would learn
not only that you can engage in effective conversations with others, but that even if you
make a mistake from time to time, it doesn’t really matter.
The strategies discussed in this section are useful for increasing the intensity of your
exposure practices by testing out the validity of your “What if?” thoughts. Rather than
dwelling on questions like “What if I make a mistake?” or “What if I draw attention to
myself?” we suggest that you try to answer these questions by purposefully making a
mistake or purposefully drawing attention to your behavior. In all likelihood, you will
discover that nothing terrible happens.

Purposefully Making Mistakes or Trying to Look Stupid

When you have begun feeling more comfortable in some of your feared situations,
a reasonable next step is to make some small mistakes purposefully, or to do things that
make you look foolish or stupid. Examples of this kind of purposeful behavior include
pronouncing a word incorrectly while speaking to your boss, asking an obvious question
in class, or bumping into a door. There is no need to make big mistakes (for example,
purposefully failing an exam or crashing your car). Small mistakes will work just fine, and
the consequences will be minimal.

Purposefully Drawing Attention to Yourself

If being the center of attention is difficult for you, your exposure practices should
include attempts to draw the attention of others to your behavior. For example, rather
than arriving early or on time for a movie or a class, try arriving a few minutes late,
so that everyone is aware of you when you enter the room. You may feel embarrassed
momentarily, but you will learn from the practice that the whole experience doesn’t
matter, even minutes later. Your embarrassment will be temporary. Also, people prob-
ably will forget about your late arrival almost instantly and soon will be thinking about
other things.


```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
Purposefully Increasing Your Anxiety Symptoms

In addition to entering the situations you fear, a more complete test of your anxiety-
provoking beliefs is to deliberately arouse some of the symptoms that frighten you in
social or performance situations. Chapter 9 discusses these strategies in some detail.
Some examples of possible exposure exercises include the following: wetting your fore-
head (to simulate sweating) before giving a presentation, purposefully appearing to lose
your train of thought during a meeting or presentation, and purposefully allowing your
hands to shake while writing or holding a drink. By deliberately bringing on the symp-
toms you fear (in a predictable and controlled way), you will learn to be less frightened
of having these symptoms show in front of others.

Expressing Personal Opinions

Finally, if you are afraid to express personal opinions during a conversation, just
engaging in conversations, without expressing personal opinions, will not be enough to
test the validity of your fearful beliefs. Conversation alone will not teach you that your
fears are unfounded. Instead, you should make sure that you express your feelings or
opinions during your exposure practices.

DEVELOPING A SITUATIONAL EXPOSURE

HIERARCHY

Before beginning exposure therapy, it is helpful to generate a list of very specific situ-
ations that range in difficulty from mildly to extremely anxiety-producing. This list of
situations, called a _situational exposure hierarchy_ , will help to guide your exposure practices.
Usually, the situations on the hierarchy include details that take into account particular
themes that contribute to how much fear you are likely to experience. These themes may
include the size of the group or audience (for example, it may be easier to talk to one person
than five people; five people may be easier to handle than fifty), the length of time involved
(for instance, a five-minute conversation vs. a thirty-minute conversation), your relationship
with the other person (for example, a family member vs. a stranger), and so on.
Two examples of situational exposure hierarchies follow. The first hierarchy is for a
person with the fear of public speaking, and the second is for someone who experiences
social anxiety in many different situations (in other words, generalized social anxiety).
Note that the hierarchy items are very specific with respect to the duration of the prac-
tice, the types of people present, and other relevant variables. Developing specific items
is important because it’s difficult to develop practices based on overly vague hierar-
chy items. Fear and avoidance ratings are based on a scale ranging from 0 (no fear, no
avoidance) to 100 (maximum fear, complete avoidance).

To generate your own hierarchy, refer back to the suggested exposure practices in
this chapter as well as to the results of your self-assessment in chapter 3. Choose situations
that range in difficulty from slightly anxiety-provoking to completely overwhelming.
Record these situations in order of difficulty (starting with the most anxiety-pro-
voking at the top) in the spaces provided on the following blank Situational Exposure
Hierarchy Form. Next, rate each situation to describe the level of fear you would feel
if you were in that situation right now (use any number from 0 to 100, where 0 = no
fear; 25 = mild fear; 50 = moderate fear; 75 = intense fear; and 100 = very intense
fear). Finally, using a 0- to 100-point scale, indicate how much you would tend to avoid
each situation on your hierarchy (0 = do not avoid the situation; 25 = hesitate to enter
situation, but rarely avoid it; 50 = sometimes avoid the situation; 75 = usually avoid the
situation; 100 = always avoid the situation).

IMAGINED EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL SITUATIONS

Whenever possible, in vivo exposure (actual exposure to feared situations) is preferable
to exposure in the imagination. In fact, imagined exposure is rarely used for treating
social anxiety. Still, exposure in the imagination may be useful either when the real situ-
ation is too overwhelming for you to enter or when you are unable to confront the actual
situation for practical reasons (for instance, you have an upcoming college exam and no
earlier opportunities to practice taking it).
Imagined exposure may be helpful to prepare you to enter the actual situation.
When you are using imagined exposure, the guidelines are generally the same as for in
vivo exposure. For example, practices should be frequent (if possible, daily) and should
continue until your fear decreases (for example, thirty to sixty minutes). Whenever pos-
sible, imagined exposure should be followed by in vivo exposure in the actual situation.
When conducting imagined exposure practices, close your eyes and try to imagine
the situation as vividly as possible. Some people find it helpful to make a tape recording
describing the situation in detail and then listen to the tape during subsequent practices.
Other people find it helpful simply to imagine being in the situation, without the help of
a recorded description. Either way, it’s important to imagine the experience vividly, so
that it feels as real as possible. Your imagined exposure practices should produce many
of the same feelings that are produced by real exposure, although the intensity of these
feelings may be lower during imagined exposure. We recommend that you ask yourself
the following questions to help bring the experience to life:

```
UÊ What do I see around me? What do my surroundings look like? Who else
is here?
```
```
UÊ What is happening in this situation?
```
```
UÊ What emotions am I feeling?
```
```
UÊ What thoughts am I thinking?
```
```
UÊ What physical sensations am I experiencing? How intense are they?
```
```
UÊ What is my environment like? Is it hot? Humid?
```
```
UÊ What am I doing while in this situation?
```
```
UÊ What sounds am I hearing?
```
```
UÊ What odors am I sensing?
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

SITUATIONAL ROLE-PLAY

A _situational role-play_ is an exposure practice in which you rehearse being in a simulated
social situation before actually entering the real situation. Role-play can provide you
with exposure practice without creating the same social risks that are sometimes present
in the actual situation. In other words, you have less to lose during simulated exposures,
compared with real-life exposures. Below are some examples of how to use situational
role-plays to improve your level of comfort, as well as to improve your skills for dealing
with particular social situations:

```
UÊ Before giving a formal presentation at work, practice giving your talk to
several friends and relatives. Ask your simulated audience for feedback. If
possible, repeat this role-play practice several times.
```
```
UÊ If you’re nervous about making small talk with strangers at parties, ask
your partner (or any close friend or relative) to pretend to be an unfamiliar
person. Imagine that you have both arrived early for a party and are waiting
in the living room while the host prepares food in the kitchen. Practice
engaging in small talk, as if you have just met for the first time.
```
```
UÊ If you have an upcoming job interview, you can prepare by having friends
or relatives simulate interviewing you for a job.
```
```
UÊ In order to practice asking another individual out on a date, you could
rehearse what you might say with a close friend or relative.

USING EXPOSURE RECORDS AND DIARIES

Keeping good records during exposure practices will help you to monitor your progress
over time. The Exposure Monitoring Form at the end of this chapter is an example of a
diary that can be used to record your experiences during exposure practices. In addition,
this form is designed to help you challenge your anxious thoughts during exposure prac-
tices. Note that although the Exposure Monitoring Form may seem somewhat complex
at first, with practice it will become easier to complete.
At the top of the form, you should describe the particular situation that you’re
practicing; the date, time, and duration of the practice; and your fear level before and
after the practice (use a 0- to 100-point scale, where 0 = no fear and 100 = maximum
fear). The middle part of the form is used for testing the validity of your fearful beliefs
and predictions regarding the exposure practice. The first three columns are completed
before the practice, and the last column is completed after the practice.
In the first column, record your emotional response to the upcoming practice
(responses like fear or nervousness). The second and third columns are used for record-
ing your fearful beliefs and predictions, as well as the evidence regarding the validity
of these predictions. (Chapter 6 has many examples of possible fearful beliefs as well
as instructions on how to evaluate the evidence concerning these thoughts.) After the
practice is completed, record the outcome of the practice (what actually happened), any
new evidence generated by the practice, and what you learned about the accuracy of
your original anxiety-provoking thoughts and predictions.
In the lower part of the form, there is space to record your fear level periodically
during the practice, using a scale ranging from 0 (no fear) to 100 (maximum fear). The
frequency with which you record your fear ratings will depend on the duration of the
practice. For example, ratings might be recorded every minute for a practice lasting ten
minutes, or every thirty minutes for a practice lasting all day. There is space to provide
up to twenty fear ratings during the practice, though you will probably not need that
many. The last step is to plan for your next practice by answering the question, “Based
on this experience, what exposure will I do next?”

A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO CONDUCTING

EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL SITUATIONS

```
A comprehensive exposure-based treatment should include the following steps:
```
```
UÊ Develop a situational exposure hierarchy. Although the hierarchy should
be used to guide your exposure practices, you can be flexible. For example,
feel free to work on situations that are not on your hierarchy. In addition,
you may decide to revise your hierarchy as particular situations become less
anxiety-provoking.
```

```
Exposure to Social Situations
```
```
UÊ Plan your exposure practices on a week-by-week basis. At the start of each
week, you should have a good idea of the types of practices that you will
conduct over the coming week, as well as the dates and times you’ll conduct
these practices.
```
```
UÊ Develop a long-term exposure plan. You should have an idea of the types
of situations in which you are likely to conduct exposure practices over
the coming months. Of course, this plan probably will change frequently,
depending on the results of your practices each week.
```
```
UÊ Start with exposure to situations that are near the bottom or middle of
your hierarchy. If a situation is too difficult, try something easier. If a prac-
tice doesn’t create anxiety, try something more difficult.
```
```
UÊ Gradually increase the difficulty level of practices. As exposures to par-
ticular situations become easier, begin practicing exposure in situations that
are more anxiety-provoking.
```
INTEGRATING SITUATIONAL EXPOSURE

STRATEGIES INTO YOUR TREATMENT PLAN

Although exposure to feared situations is perhaps the most important technique for
overcoming your fear, the exposure methods described in this chapter (and in chapter 7)
are often most effective when they are used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
In addition to situational exposure, your treatment should include the cognitive strate-
gies described in chapter 6, which will help you to reinterpret your experiences during
exposure to feared situations. As we reviewed earlier in this book, we recommend that
you first practice the cognitive techniques for several weeks before formally beginning
exposure practices.
Also, your treatment program may include medication (chapter 5), exposure to
feared sensations (chapter 9), and social-skills practices (chapter 10), depending on your
own personal needs and preferences. As you will see, these strategies are typically used
in the context of your own situational exposure practices. Exposure is the foundation
around which the other treatment strategies are introduced.

CHAPTER 9

### Exposure to

### Uncomfortable Sensations

Symptom exposure (also called _interoceptive exposure_ ), involves intentional exposure to inter-
nal physical sensations, such as dizziness, racing heart, sweating, shaking, and blushing.
This technique was originally developed as a treatment for an anxiety-based condition
known as _panic disorder_. Panic disorder is a problem in which people experience sudden
rushes of fear without any obvious trigger or cause. People with panic disorder tend to
be very fearful of the physical sensations they experience during their panic attacks,
and they often interpret these symptoms as a sign of imminent danger or threat (like an
impending heart attack or a complete loss of control). Symptom exposure was developed
to teach those with panic disorder to stop fearing the physical feelings associated with
physical arousal and anxiety. With repeated exposure to these induced physical symp-
toms, people learn that these feelings are not dangerous, and they eventually become
less frightened of their own internal feelings and sensations.
Anxiety over experiencing physical arousal symptoms is not unique to panic dis-
order. A number of studies (Chambless and Gracely 1989; Taylor, Koch, and McNally
1992) have found that people with other anxiety-based problems are also often anxious
about experiencing certain physical sensations. This includes people with social anxiety,
where the fear may be strongest for sensations that might be visible to others, including
blushing, sweating, shaking, and losing one’s train of thought. Just as symptom exposure
leads to reduced fear of sensations in people with panic disorder, it makes sense that
deliberately exposing oneself to feared symptoms while in social situations might lead to
decreased fear of sensations for people with high levels of social anxiety. By combining


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

symptom exposure and situational exposure, you will learn that you can not only toler-
ate being in feared situations with your usual levels of physical arousal, but that you can
tolerate the situation even when your feared physical sensations are particularly intense.
By bringing on these sensations in a controlled and predicable way, you will learn to be
less anxious about experiencing them in social situations.
Although there hasn’t been much research on the use of symptom exposure in social
anxiety, we have found that this technique is often helpful for those who suffer from
excessive social and performance fears (Antony and Swinson 2000; Antony and Rowa
2008). The techniques described in this chapter are not meant to be used instead of
the strategies described in earlier chapters. In fact, to overcome your social anxiety, the
most important strategies are the cognitive techniques described in chapter 6 and the
situational exposure strategies described in chapters 7 and 8. You should not attempt to
use symptom exposure until you have practiced the strategies described in chapters 6
through 8 and are thoroughly familiar with them.
Furthermore, before attempting the symptom exposure techniques, you should
be very familiar with the basic rules of exposure. As reviewed in chapter 7, exposure
works best if it is practiced frequently, if each practice lasts long enough to show that
your feared consequences don’t come true, and if practices are predictable and under
your control. In addition, the cognitive strategies described in chapter 6 should be used
to combat anxious thinking before, during, and after your exposure practices. Finally,
during your exposure practices, you should not use subtle avoidance techniques such as
distraction, drug or alcohol use, or other safety behaviors (for example, wearing makeup
to hide blushing).

INTRODUCTION TO SYMPTOM EXPOSURE

Symptom exposure involves using specific exercises to bring on physical sensations that
make you uncomfortable or anxious. Initially, the exercises are practiced in “safe” situa-
tions, like your home. After you get used to the exercises, the next step is to try them
in anxiety-provoking situations, such as immediately before entering a social or perfor-
mance situation. Examples of symptom exposure exercises are listed here, along with
the sensations they typically trigger (Antony et al. 2006; Antony and Swinson 2000).
In addition to this list, there are many other possible exercises that can be used. For
example, if you are afraid of a choking or gagging feeling in your throat, wearing a
necktie or scarf may be a good way of creating this feeling for the purpose of exposure
therapy. It’s best to consider these exercises only as a partial list. At the end of the list,
there is space for you to record additional exercises that might be useful for triggering
symptoms that you fear.

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

IS SYMPTOM EXPOSURE FOR YOU?

Although symptom exposure is likely to be helpful for many who suffer from social
anxiety, it’s usually possible to reduce social anxiety without this particular strategy. In
fact, for some people, there may be little reason to use these exercises at all. Symptom
exposure is likely to be helpful to you if either of the following statements is true:

```
UÊ You are generally afraid of experiencing anxiety symptoms such as a rapidly
beating heart, dizziness, shaking, blushing, or sweating.
```
```
UÊ You are afraid of experiencing anxiety symptoms in front of other people.
```
If you’re fearful of experiencing physical arousal feelings in general or when in social
or performance situations, we recommend trying the exercises described in this chapter.
However, if you are not fearful of the sensations that you experience when anxious, and
you are not concerned about others noticing your anxiety symptoms, then there is no
need to practice these exercises. In fact, you can skip ahead to chapter 10.

HOW DOES SYMPTOM EXPOSURE WORK?

Like situational exposure, symptom exposure is believed to decrease fear by disprov-
ing a person’s fearful beliefs, assumptions, and predictions. By deliberately bringing on
uncomfortable feelings in a controlled and predictable way, you will learn that (1) you
can control the sensations that normally appear to be uncontrollable and (2) even if you
do experience noticeable physical feelings in front of other people, the consequences
are likely to be minimal.
By learning to allow yourself to be anxious in front of other people, and to allow
others to observe your anxiety symptoms, eventually you will become less concerned
about your anxiety reactions and about what people think when they notice your shaking,
sweating, blushing, or other signs of anxiety. By becoming less concerned about experi-
encing these feelings, you will probably become less anxious when exposed to social and
performance situations.


```
Exposure to Uncomfortable Sensations
```
A WARNING ABOUT SYMPTOM EXPOSURE

If you are healthy, the exercises described in this chapter are safe. However, if you have
certain health problems, some of the exercises could worsen your condition. For example,
if you have asthma or a bad cold, you should probably not practice hyperventilation or
breathing through a straw. If you experience neck or back pain, we recommend against
shaking your head from side to side or engaging in any exercises that could aggravate
your condition. To be safe, we recommend checking with your doctor to see if any of
these exercises are likely to be dangerous or problematic for you.

A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO SYMPTOM EXPOSURE

This section describes the four main steps involved in using symptom exposure to over-
come the fear of experiencing physical arousal sensations. These include (1) discovering
which exercises are most effective for bringing on feared symptoms, (2) developing a
symptom exposure hierarchy, (3) practicing the exercises in nonsocial situations, and (4)
combining the symptom exposure exercises with exposure practices in social situations.

Step 1: Symptom Induction Testing

Before beginning to practice symptom exposure exercises on a regular basis, you
should first determine which exercises are most likely to be effective for you. This can
be achieved by attempting each exercise at home and paying attention to the types of
symptoms that you experience, the effect of the exercises on your fear level, and how
similar the experience is to the fear that you normally experience in social situations.
The following Symptom Induction Testing Form can be used to record your responses
to each exercise. We have included space for additional exercises that you may have
identified earlier in the chapter.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

**Symptom Induction Testing Form**

**Instructions** : After trying each symptom exposure exercise, (1) record the physical sen-
sations that were experienced and (2) rate the intensity of fear experienced using a scale
of 0 (no fear) to 100 (maximum fear).

Step 2: Developing Symptom Exposure Hierarchies

Just as the situational exposure hierarchy described in chapter 8 is used to guide your
situational exposure practices, _symptom exposure hierarchies_ are useful for choosing appropri-
ate symptom exposure exercises. In most cases, we recommend that you develop two
symptom exposure hierarchies: one for practicing the exercises outside of social situa-
tions (see step 3) and a second hierarchy for practicing symptom exposure while in (or
immediately before entering) social or performance situations (see step 4). If you are
not at all fearful of experiencing anxiety sensations outside of social situations, then
developing a hierarchy for practicing symptom exposure in nonsocial situations is less
important. Instead, you should focus on exercises to practice while exposed to social and
performance situations.
To develop a hierarchy for symptom exposure, first eliminate any exercises that
you know will not make you anxious (based on the results of your symptom induction
testing, completed in step 1). For example, if the sensations created by physical exercise
(something like jogging) are not frightening to you at all, eliminate this exercise from
your list. Next, take the remaining exercises and put them in order of difficulty, with the
least anxiety-provoking exercise at the bottom and the most anxiety-provoking item at
the top. Record your level of expected fear for each exercise, using a scale ranging from
0 (no fear) to 100 (maximum fear). Examples of symptom exposure hierarchies reflecting
practices outside of social situations and practices in social situations follow. We have
also included space to record your own hierarchies.

Step 3: Practicing Symptom Exposure in
Nonsocial Situations
```
If you are not fearful of practicing the symptom exposure exercises in nonsocial
situations, it is not necessary to spend a lot of time on step 3. However, if there are
exercises that you intend to practice in social situations (step 4), we recommend that


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

you first try them a few times in nonsocial situations to make sure that you are familiar
with the exercise.
If there are exercises that are anxiety-provoking for you in nonsocial situations, we
recommend that you practice them repeatedly at home or in another comfortable loca-
tion place before practicing in social situations. Use your symptom exposure hierarchy
for nonsocial situations to help you choose which exercises to practice. Begin with exer-
cises that are challenging but unlikely to be so overwhelming that you cannot complete
them. After you have chosen an exercise, set aside about fifteen minutes twice a day
to practice the exercise repeatedly. After each repetition of the exercise, take a short
break (from thirty seconds to a few minutes) until the symptoms decrease. Continue to
practice the exercise another five or six times or until your fear has decreased. Later in
this chapter, you will find a diary you can use to record the results of each practice and
to challenge any anxiety-provoking thoughts that arise during the practice.
Each time you complete an exercise, you will experience the physical symptoms
associated with it. However, your fear of the symptoms should decrease across individual
practices and across days. For example, if you are practicing hyperventilation, you will
likely continue to become hot and lightheaded each time you do the exercise. However,
over time, these feelings should become less frightening.

Step 4: Practicing Symptom Exposure in Social Situations

After you have practiced situational exposure (chapter 8) and symptom exposure
in nonsocial situations, the next step is to combine these two approaches. Combining
symptom and situational exposure is one of the most challenging types of exposure
that you can practice. However, this type of exposure can also provide you with the
strongest possible evidence that your anxious predictions are exaggerated or untrue. By
entering the social and performance situations that you fear and purposefully inducing
arousal sensations to enhance your fear, you will learn that these situations are man-
ageable even when you feel extremely uncomfortable. To select possible exercises for
combining symptom and situational exposure, refer back to your symptom exposure
hierarchy for practices in social situations (step 2).

INTEGRATING SYMPTOM EXPOSURE INTO

YOUR TREATMENT PLAN

As discussed earlier, we recommend that your psychological treatment program (cogni-
tive behavioral therapy) begin with the cognitive strategies discussed in chapter 6. After
practicing the cognitive techniques for several weeks, you should practice situational
exposure for several more weeks or months until you feel more comfortable in social
situations (chapters 7 and 8). Only then should you consider adding symptom exposure


```
Exposure to Uncomfortable Sensations
```
if you are still fearful of experiencing anxiety symptoms in front of others. As your fear
continues to decrease through exposure and cognitive therapy, you may also consider
working on your social and communication skills (chapter 10).

USING SYMPTOM EXPOSURE RECORDS

AND DIARIES

Keeping good records during symptom exposure practices will help you to monitor your
progress over time. The Symptom Exposure Diary at the end of this chapter will help
you to measure changes in your fear across symptom exposure practices. Furthermore,
this diary is designed to help you challenge your anxious thoughts during exposure
practices. The first column indicates the trial number (1, 2, 3, and so on). In the second
column, you should record the specific sensations that you experience. In the third
column, record your fear level during each exercise trial. Finally, the fourth and fifth
columns are for recording your anxious thoughts during the exercise and for countering
your thoughts with more realistic beliefs.

TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem:** The symptom exposure exercises don’t frighten me.

**Solution:** If the exercises don’t cause anxiety when you practice them in nonsocial
situations, try practicing them immediately before entering social situa-
tions. If they still don’t increase your fear, then discontinue the symptom
exposure exercises. However, you should continue to use the cognitive
strategies (chapter 6) and the situational exposure exercises (chapters 7
and 8).

**Problem:** The symptom exposure exercises are too overwhelming for me to complete.

**Solution:** If a symptom exposure exercise is too overwhelming, even when conducted
in a nonsocial situation, try an easier exercise from your hierarchy and
don’t move on to the more difficult exercises until the easier ones become
manageable. If you find that a symptom exposure exercise is overwhelming
only when practiced in the context of a social or performance situation,
you can practice an easier exercise from your symptom exposure hierarchy
and work your way up to the more difficult exercises. Or, you can continue
to practice situational exposure without the symptom exposure exercises.
Hold off on introducing symptom exposure practices in social situations
until you are able to manage the situation on its own (without symptom
exposure).

CHAPTER 10

### Communicating

### More Effectively

Are there times when your behavior communicates to others a message that’s different
from what you are trying to communicate? Do you freeze up in interviews? Do you tend
to avoid eye contact when talking to other people? Does your body language tell others
to _stay away_? Do you read your presentations verbatim so you don’t make any mistakes?
Do others often feel as though you aren’t listening to them? Do people misinterpret
your shyness as a sign of aloofness or a snobby attitude? This chapter is all about how
to communicate effectively and to get your message across in the way you intend.

GETTING YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS

For some people, a consequence of avoiding social situations is never having the oppor-
tunity to master the communication skills that would help them deal effectively with
others. For example, if your fear has stopped you from applying for jobs or asking people
out on dates, you may not always know how to best deal with these situations (what to
say, what to wear, how to behave, and so on). The ability to interact effectively with
other people must be learned and it takes practice, just like learning to play the piano or
training to run a marathon. As you get more experience being in the situations you avoid,
and learning what works and what doesn’t, your performance is likely to improve. This
chapter provides ideas for enhancing the quality of your interactions with other people.
Most of these strategies can be used during the course of your situational exposure
practices (chapters 7 and 8).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

As you read this chapter, there are a few important points to keep in mind. First, our
purpose in writing this chapter is not to suggest that you lack social skills. In fact, most
people we have worked with who have problems with social anxiety have fine social skills
overall. If anything, your social and communication skills are probably already much
better than you think they are. Rather, our aim is to help you increase your awareness
of the different ways in which your behavior may impact others and to change specific
behaviors where appropriate.
You should also bear in mind that there is no such thing as perfect social skills. What
works best in one situation or with one group of people may not work well in another
situation or with another group. For example, the best way to ask one person out on a
date may cause a rejection from someone else. Although a particular style may help you
get one job, it may work against you for another job or with another interviewer. In other
words, no matter how well-developed your social skills are, they can never be perfect.
Like everyone, you will continue to stumble from time to time and occasionally you will
make a bad impression on other people.
Finally, the strategies described in this chapter should not be thought of as rules to
be followed by everyone. Rather, they are suggestions and guidelines that you may find
helpful in some situations. For example, we suggest that certain types of body language
(for example, standing too far away from another person during a conversation) may
be interpreted as a sign of aloofness or that you are uninterested in talking. However,
standing too close also may cause other people to feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately,
it’s very difficult to determine the ideal amount of “personal space.” What works well
with one person may not work as well with another. Personal space preferences also vary
across ethnic groups and subcultures. That is, among some groups, standing quite close
to the person with whom you’re speaking is the norm. But in another group that norm
might cause great discomfort. Given that it is often difficult to know how to behave in
a particular situation, it’s best not to get too caught up in whether you are using these
strategies perfectly or whether you’re making a perfect impression on others.
Examples of communication skills discussed in this chapter are provided here.
As you read through the list, pay attention to the specific skills you are interested in
improving.

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Of course, it is impossible to thoroughly cover all of these topics in a single chapter.
Indeed, numerous books have been written on each of these particular domains (pre-
sentations, interviews, dating, assertiveness, listening, and so on). For more detailed
suggestions, consult some of the recommended readings cited throughout this chapter
and in the list of additional recommended readings at the back of the book. In addi-
tion, there are a number of good books that cover a wide range of topics related to
social and communication skills. Some examples include _Messages: The Communication Skills
Book_ (McKay, Davis, and Fanning 1995), _The Messages Workbook: Powerful Strategies for Effective
Communication at Work & Home_ (Davis, Paleg, and Fanning 2004), and Robert Bolton’s classic
book, _People Skills_ (19 7 9).
Finally, you may want to check out a website that uses video to demonstrate how
to do a wide range of things—everything from sewing to cooking to magic tricks. The
site is [http://www.videojug.com.](http://www.videojug.com.) In addition to being a great place to learn all sorts of inter-
esting skills, the site includes video demonstrations of various social behaviors, includ-
ing making a good first impression, dating, hugging, kissing, complaining appropriately,
looking approachable, and even how to give a great handshake! Just search for the
behavior you want to see.

LEARNING TO LISTEN

Communication is a two-way street. Listening effectively when you are in a conversa-
tion, being interviewed, or participating in a meeting is as important as what you say.
When you feel anxious, your attention tends to shift from the situation itself to your
own experiences in the situation. In other words, you become aware of how you’re
feeling, and you begin to wonder whether your anxiety symptoms are noticeable to
the other people in the room and whether those people are judging you negatively.
At the same time, you become less aware of other aspects of the situation, including
what other people are saying. This lack of concentration on what others are saying
may reinforce your uncertainty about whether your responses are appropriate. Often,
even when you think you are listening, you may be only partially aware of what is
being said.
There are several costs to not listening. First, you may miss important informa-
tion that the other person is trying to communicate. You may hear only the parts of
the message that are consistent with your anxious beliefs, thereby increasing your
anxiety. For example, if you hear only your boss’ negative comments and miss his or
her praise during a performance evaluation, you will undoubtedly feel worse than if
you had heard the entire evaluation. Not hearing the entire message also may lead you
to respond inappropriately, sometimes to something completely different than what
was actually said. Furthermore, the other person may sense that you are not listen-
ing to what is being said. As a result, you may be perceived by that person as aloof,
distracted, or bored by the conversation.


```
Communicating More Effectively
```
Blocks to Effective Listening

In _Messages: The Communication Skills Book,_ authors McKay, Davis, and Fanning list a
number of different factors that frequently interfere with our ability to listen to others
during conversations, meetings, arguments, and other types of social interactions. Of
these, five are especially common when people feel anxious in a social situation. These
listening blocks include the following:

```
UÊ Comparing yourself to the other person. We all compare ourselves to others
as a way to evaluate our own behavior and accomplishments. However,
excessive social anxiety may be associated with the tendency to do this
more often, to make unfavorable comparisons (for instance, comparisons
with those who are more successful on a particular dimension), and to feel
bad after making such comparisons. This tendency to make negative com-
parisons while conversing (for example, criticizing yourself with unspoken
comments such as, “I’m not as smart as he is” or “She is more attractive than
I am”) interferes with your ability to listen to and hear what is being said.
```
```
UÊ Filtering what the other person says. Filtering involves listening only to
certain parts of what the other person is saying. In social anxiety, this can
involve paying attention only to those parts of the conversation that seem
to indicate that the other person is being critical or judgmental.
```
```
UÊ Rehearsing what to say next. When people are overly concerned about
saying the right thing during conversations or meetings, they often rehearse
mentally how they will respond to other people’s comments rather than
truly listening to what is being said. Although you may engage in rehearsal
to make sure you say the right thing, this practice, if used too often, may
have the opposite effect.
```
```
UÊ Derailing the conversation. Derailing involves switching the topic of con-
versation when it becomes either boring or uncomfortable. In social anxiety,
derailing may take place when the conversation moves into anxiety-provok-
ing areas. For example, if a coworker asks you about your weekend and
you are embarrassed to admit that you stayed home alone all weekend, you
might shift the conversation back to a work-related topic, rather than dis-
close what you perceive to be overly personal information. Derailing can
make the other person feel as though you are not listening or are not inter-
ested in the conversation.
```
```
UÊ Placating the other person. Placating involves agreeing with the other
person regardless of what he or she says in an effort to avoid potential con-
flict. Because social anxiety is associated with a fear of being disliked or neg-
atively judged, people who are socially anxious often go out of their way to
agree with others. However, most people don’t expect to have others agree
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
with them all the time. If you always agree with whatever is said, it may raise
the other person’s suspicions about whether you’re really listening.
```
Improving Your Listening Skills

The authors of _Messages_ provide a number of suggestions for improving listening
skills. First, they suggest that effective listening should involve active participation rather
than just sitting quietly and absorbing the information. Active listening involves main-
taining appropriate eye contact, paraphrasing what the person has said (“So, in other
words, what you are saying is.. .”), asking for clarification (asking questions to help
you understand what was said), and providing the other person with feedback (or your
reactions to what he or she said). Whenever possible, feedback should be immediate (as
soon as you understand the communication), honest (reflecting your true feelings), and
supportive (in other words, gentle and unlikely to be hurtful to the other person).
In addition, it’s important to listen with _empathy_. Being empathic means conveying
the idea that you genuinely understand the other person’s message as well as the feelings
he or she is experiencing. As discussed in chapter 6, there are many different ways of
interpreting a given situation. By trying to understand another person’s perspective, you
will be better able to listen and to communicate that fact. Note that it is not necessary
for you to agree with the other person’s perspective—just to understand it. However,
even when someone says something that you believe to be completely incorrect, you
probably can identify at least a small part of the message that is true. Letting the person
know that you understand his or her perspective conveys empathy, even if you don’t
agree with the overall content of what was said.
Finally, effective listening requires listening with openness and awareness. _Openness_
involves listening without trying to find fault. _Awareness_ involves (1) being aware of how
a communication fits in with your own knowledge and experiences, and (2) being aware
of any inconsistencies in the verbal message itself and the nonverbal aspects of the
communication, such as tone, posture, and facial expressions.

**Exercise: Effective Listening**

The next time you’re in a conversation, try some of the effective listening skills described
above:

1. Make eye contact during the conversation.
2. Paraphrase what the other person says, and ask for clarification if you’re
    unsure about any aspect of the communication.
3. Give feedback when appropriate, making sure that your feedback is immedi-
    ate, honest, and supportive.


```
Communicating More Effectively
```
4. Finally, make sure that you are listening with empathy, openness, and
    awareness.

After trying this exercise in a real-life situation, come back to this chapter and list on
the lines below any ways in which the experience was different from your usual conver-
sations. Did the conversation last longer? Was it more gratifying? Did the other person
respond differently to you? Did you experience less anxiety than usual?

NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION

When you feel anxious in a social situation, you probably engage in behaviors designed
to subtly avoid communicating with others. These may include avoiding eye contact,
speaking very quietly, or even avoiding the situation completely. Despite your efforts to
avoid communication, however, it’s virtually impossible _not_ to communicate. In fact, what
you actually say in words during a conversation makes up a very small component of the
messages you communicate to others. Nonverbal aspects of communication, including
your physical distance from others, eye contact, posture, tone of voice, and vocal volume
communicate at least as much information as your verbal messages. In fact, even when
you completely stay away from a feared social situation, you communicate a message to
others. For example, if you repeatedly avoid meetings at work, others may assume that
you are shy, uninterested, or even unfriendly.
Despite wanting others to respond positively, people who are shy or socially anxious
often exhibit nonverbal behaviors that communicate to others, “Stay away from me.”
Examples of these closed nonverbal behaviors include leaning back or standing far away
from other people, avoiding eye contact, speaking quietly, crossing your arms over your
chest, clenching your fists, and maintaining a serious facial expression. Although you
may believe that these behaviors serve as a form of protection in anxiety-provoking
situations, they tend to have the opposite effect.
Instead of protecting you from potential threat or from being judged by others,
these behaviors probably increase the likelihood that others will react negatively. For
example, at a party, people are most likely to approach someone who is smiling, making
eye contact, and talking at a reasonable volume. When someone stands far away, speaks
quietly, and avoids eye contact, it is natural to assume that the individual is either
uninterested in speaking or difficult to get to know.
Of course, moderation is the key here. Too much eye contact can make others
uncomfortable. In addition, someone who stands too close or smiles at inappropriate


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

times may make others feel uneasy. Unfortunately, it is impossible to specify the appro-
priate intensity for each of these behaviors because so many variables play a role. What
is appropriate in one situation is not necessarily appropriate in another. For example,
although it’s okay to stand several inches away from a romantic partner during an inti-
mate conversation, you probably would want to stand farther back when talking to a
coworker. With respect to nonverbal communication, there are differences across gender
and across cultures. Therefore, we suggest that you experiment with using different
nonverbal behaviors to find out what works best for you in the particular situations that
you encounter from day to day.
_Closed nonverbal behaviors_ are behaviors that close the channels of communication by
sending the message that the opportunity for contact or communication with you is unavail-
able. Below is a list of closed nonverbal behaviors often associated with social anxiety:

```
UÊ Leaning back while sitting (vs. leaning forward)
```
```
UÊ Standing far away from another person (vs. standing closer)
```
```
UÊ Avoiding eye contact (vs. making appropriate eye contact)
```
```
UÊ Speaking quietly (vs. speaking at a volume that is easily heard)
```
```
UÊ Crossing arms (vs. keeping arms uncrossed or making hand gestures)
```
```
UÊ Clenching fists (vs. keeping hands open)
```
```
UÊ Maintaining a serious facial expression (vs. smiling warmly)
```
```
UÊ Speaking with a timid tone (vs. speaking with a confident tone)
```
```
UÊ Sitting hunched over (vs. sitting up straight)
```
**Exercise: Open Behaviors**

Do you tend to overuse any of these behaviors? If so, try to replace some of your closed
behaviors with open behaviors during the course of your exposure practices over the next
week. Record your experiences in the provided space. For example, record whether people
react differently to you when you smile more, make eye contact, or speak more loudly.

CONVERSATIONAL SKILLS

Do you often struggle to find things to say when making casual conversation or small
talk? Do you keep quiet at parties or meetings because you find it difficult to contribute
to conversations? When you do get involved in a conversation, perhaps you find that
the discussion fizzles quickly, as you and the other person run out of things to say. In
this section, we discuss ways of starting and ending conversations, as well as methods
of improving the quality of your conversations. These suggestions may be adapted for
different types of conversations, including talking to a coworker or classmate, conversing
on a date, or speaking with a stranger while waiting in line.
Keep in mind that the suggestions in this section are not always going to work
smoothly. For example, if you start talking to someone in an elevator, the person may
respond positively or may frown and ignore you. If an individual responds negatively
when you try to make contact, remember that it’s not necessarily because you did some-
thing wrong. The other person may be shy or may be concerned about his or her safety
(having been raised never to talk to strangers). Also, it’s possible that your communica-
tion will be misunderstood. If things don’t work out during a particular practice, try to
understand why and to figure out what you can do differently next time. Learning from
your experiences will help you to plan future practices that are more likely to work out
satisfactorily.
Finally, if you want to learn more about making conversation, we recommend that
you read the third edition of Alan Garner’s book, _Conversationally Speaking: Testing New Ways
to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectiveness_ (1997). Another excellent book on improving
conversation skills is _Talk to Me: Conversation Tips for the Small-Talk Challenged_ (Honeychurch
and Watrous 2003).

Starting a Conversation

Although getting a conversation started is sometimes difficult, it often becomes
easier with practice. Opportunities to start conversations are everywhere. For example,
people often speak to strangers in grocery store lines and elevators, or on buses, subways,
airplanes, and in other public places. People talk to others at parties, weddings, funer-
als, and work functions. If you are at a party, it is perfectly appropriate to walk up to
a group of people who are already talking. After a minute or two of standing around
with the group, you can join in the conversation. If you are a college student, you can
increase your opportunities for casual conversation by always sitting in the same area of
the classroom so you’ll have repeated exposure to some of the same students each time.
Also, arrive to class early so you can chat with others before class starts.
The topic of conversation should usually begin with something friendly and not too
personal, particularly if you don’t know the other individual very well. You may begin
with a question (something like, “How was your weekend?”), a compliment (“I like your
new haircut”), an observation (perhaps, “I notice that you’re not driving your usual car”),


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

or an introduction (“I don’t believe we’ve met. My name is.. .”). Other appropriate
topics include: hobbies, your job, a movie or TV show you recently saw, the weather,
something you recently read, your vacation, a recent shopping trip or outing, and sports.
After you’ve been talking for a while, it may be appropriate to discuss more controversial
topics, such as politics, relationships, personal feelings, difficult family situations, and
topics related to sexuality. However, you should introduce topics such as these slowly,
and gauge the other person’s reactions before deciding how far to take the conversation.
Try to avoid getting too personal, unless you know the other person well or the other
person is disclosing similar types of personal information. At a party or on a first date,
it’s fine to talk about your work or what your parents do for a living, but it is usually best
to stay clear of weighty topics (like a past sexual assault, a recent history of depression,
and so on).

Improving the Quality of Your Conversations

```
Here are a few tips for improving your conversations:
```
```
UÊ Conversations are a two-way street. It’s not enough to just listen to another
person. Nor is it appropriate to talk only about yourself without giving the
other person a chance to speak. Of course, there are exceptions. There are
some people who are very happy to have you do all the talking or allow
them to do all the talking. However, for most of us, a conversation is far
more interesting if we have the opportunity to express our own thoughts,
feelings, and experiences and also the chance to listen to another person’s
views and experiences.
```
```
UÊ Use active listening skills. The active listening skills described earlier in the
chapter will enhance the quality of your conversations. In particular, be sure
to reflect back that you are understanding what the other person is saying.
```
```
UÊ Disclose some (but not too much) information about yourself. As men-
tioned earlier, the information you disclose should not be overly personal at
first. Instead, you can start by talking about your weekend’s activities, your
favorite sports team, a movie you recently saw, or a class that you’re taking,
for example.
```
```
UÊ Show interest in the other person. For instance, follow up what the other
person says by asking for clarification or requesting more details.
```
```
UÊ Try a light touch. In some situations, it may be appropriate to touch the
other individual (for example, a light touch on the arm). However, only use
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
touch if it can be done naturally, in a way that doesn’t seem overly forced.
Note that the appropriate use of touch varies between men and women and
across cultures. It may also be frowned on in professional settings.
```
```
UÊ Pay attention to detail. When telling stories, take your cues from others
when trying to decide how much detail to include. See how detailed others
are in their conversations, and model your own conversations after them. If
you notice that others are starting to look bored or look at their watches
while you tell a story, take that as a sign that it’s time to wrap it up. On the
other hand, make sure your conversation is not completely devoid of details.
Either too much detail or not enough detail can make a conversation less
engaging.
```
```
UÊ Give and receive compliments. When complimenting others, make sure you
are honest (don’t say you like something if you don’t), and don’t overdo
it. Although it’s nice to receive a compliment from time to time, it can be
uncomfortable to receive too many compliments or to receive compliments
that are felt to be undeserved. If you receive a compliment from someone
else, simply say thank you. Don’t discount the compliment or make the
other person feel bad for giving it.
```
```
UÊ Pay attention to your nonverbal behaviors. For example, make eye contact
and speak so the other person can hear you.
```
Asking Questions

**A** sking the other person questions will communicate that you are interested in what
he or she has to say. You can ask about your conversation partner’s experiences (for
example, “How was that restaurant you went to last night?”) or you can ask for the other
person’s reaction to something you’ve said. If possible, try to use open-ended questions
rather than closed-ended questions. A _closed-ended question_ is one that elicits a response
of only one or two words. For example, the closed-ended question “Did you like the
movie?” could easily lead to responses like “Yes” or “No,” at which point you would be
back at square one, trying to find another topic of conversation. Closed-ended questions
usually begin with words like “are,” “do,” “who,” “when,” “where,” and “which.”
In contrast, _open-ended questions_ usually can elicit more detailed answers. Open-ended
questions are more likely than closed-ended questions to generate longer and more inter-
esting conversations. These types of question usually begin with words or phrases like
“how,” “why,” and “in what way.” For example, the question “What did you think about
the movie?” draws out a more thorough response than “Did you like the movie?”


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
Here are some examples of closed-ended and open-ended questions:
```
```
Closed-Ended Questions Open-Ended Questions
```
```
UÊ Did you have a good weekend? UÊ What did you do this weekend?
```
```
UÊ Who is your favorite candidate? UÊ What do you like about the differ-
ent candidates?
```
```
UÊ What do you do for a living? UÊ How did you get into your current
line of work?
```
```
UÊ Do you like your psychology
professor?
```
```
UÊ Why do you like your psychology
professor?
```
Note that a question can be too open-ended, so that it is responded to as if it were
a closed-ended question. For example, questions like “How are you?” or “How was your
day?” typically lead to a one-word response such as “Fine.”

Ending Conversations

All conversations eventually come to an end. Furthermore, in informal social situa-
tions (at a party, on a date, on the phone), conversations almost always end because one
or both people lose interest in what is being talked about or they reach a point at which
they would rather be doing something else or talking to someone else.
If you are especially sensitive to rejection, you may become more anxious as a con-
versation nears its end. Or you may be hurt if you think that the other person seems less
interested in continuing to converse. Nevertheless, if you begin to pay attention to other
people’s conversations, you will notice that all discussions reach a point at which there
is little more to be said. Sometimes this point is reached in a few seconds. Other times,
it may take a few minutes or even an hour for a particularly interesting conversation to
end. Running out of things to talk about is not a failure and does not mean that you are
boring. It is a normal feature of all conversations.
Typically, people try to find graceful ways to get out of conversations that have
run their course. At a party, you might excuse yourself to refill your drink or visit the
bathroom. Or, it may be appropriate to mention politely that you need to catch up with
another person at the party. In a work setting, people often end the conversation with
a reference to work (for instance, “Well, I need to get back to work”) or a pledge to
continue the conversation later (“Perhaps we can have lunch together some time soon”).
Often, simply saying something like, “It’s been nice talking to you, but I need to run” is
sufficient. If you have enjoyed the conversation, be sure to let your conversation partner
know that (“I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. I hope we get a chance to talk again”).

**Exercise: Conversations**

Try using some of these conversational strategies the next time you’re having a conversa-
tion. If you rarely encounter situations that allow for conversation, you may need to go
out of your way to seek out such situations. During the practice, pay special attention to
using the strategies for starting the conversation, improving the quality of the conversa-
tion, and ending the conversation. In the spaces below, record your experiences after
using the relevant strategies for each phase of the conversation.

JOB INTERVIEWS

Most people feel somewhat nervous when being interviewed for a job. In fact, showing
no signs of anxiety could work against you in some interview situations. Not showing
any signs of anxiety during an interview might be interpreted by the interviewer as a sign
that you are overconfident or disinterested. But if you’re particularly anxious in social
situations, interviews may be even more anxiety-provoking for you than they are for the
average person. Chapter 6 reviewed strategies for changing the beliefs that contribute to
your anxiety in situations such as interviews. Chapters 7 and 8 recommended practicing


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

exposure to interviews (using both real interview practices and role-play simulations)
as a strategy for learning to become less anxious. In this section, we provide additional
suggestions for improving interview skills. These suggestions are meant to be used along
with the cognitive and exposure-based techniques discussed in earlier chapters.
Essentially, being prepared for an interview involves knowing what to do before
the interview, how to behave during the interview, and what to do when the interview
is over. We provide suggestions for each of these interview phases. For a more detailed
discussion of this topic, we suggest reading _Messages: The Communication Skills Book_. There
are several other excellent resources on interviewing for jobs listed in the recommended
readings section at the end of this book.

Preparing for the Interview

Here are some suggestions for preparing for an interview. These are all things to do
before you get there:

```
UÊ Before the interview, practice interviewing with friends and family members.
Also, practice interviewing for other jobs that are of less interest to you. As
we discussed in chapters 7 and 8, practicing being interviewed will help to
decrease your anxiety when you are in the actual situation.
```
```
UÊ Keep the situation in perspective. Remember that it’s only an interview. If it
doesn’t work out, there will be other opportunities. Think of the interview
as a learning experience or an opportunity to improve your interviewing
skills.
```
```
UÊ Take time to understand the purpose of the interview, learn who will be
interviewing you, what the structure of the interview will be, and how long
the interview will run. If possible, find out the interviewer’s name and make
sure you remember it. If that’s not possible, when the interviewer introduces
himself or herself to you, pay attention and try to use the name when you
say good-bye.
```
```
UÊ Learn as much as possible about the organization or company and about
the person who is interviewing you. If the organization has a website, make
sure you study it carefully. You may even be able to learn about your inter-
viewer beforehand. Being knowledgeable about the organization during the
interview will show that you really are interested in the position.
```
```
UÊ Take some time to identify your strengths and have a good idea of what
you can contribute to the organization, in case you’re asked. You may want
to take some notes with you to prevent forgetting something that you want
to mention.
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
UÊ Plan a response in case you are asked about your weaknesses or limitations.
There is no need to list every flaw that comes into your mind. Instead, you
can mention one or two limitations, phrasing them in such a way that they
are unlikely to be viewed as a problem that cannot be solved. For example,
you can choose to focus on a minor limitation in your experience or train-
ing that is unlikely to be viewed as serious. Or, you can deflect the ques-
tion by talking about a limitation that you had in the past that is no longer
a problem (something like, “When I first started my previous job, I didn’t
have much experience working with computers. However, over the past few
years, I got a lot of computer experience, so that’s not an issue anymore”).
However, don’t emphasize limitations that could be viewed as weaknesses
in your character or a reflection of your work habits (for example, “I get
angry easily” or “I’m very unorganized”), since a potential employers may
view these as harder to change. Also, avoid answering a question about your
weaknesses with a response about how you work too hard (for instance, “I
tend to work too hard, so I need to remind myself to take breaks”). This is
a very cliché response that employers will see through (no employer would
see that as a weakness). For more ideas on how to answer difficult interview
questions, check out Ron Fry’s book, 101 Great Answers to the Toughest Interview
Questions (2007).
```
```
UÊ Prepare at least ten questions you can ask during the interview. Write them
down so you won’t forget. For example, you should consider asking ques-
tions about the types of responsibilities that you are likely to have, the hours
you will be expected to work, who you will be working with, and the struc-
ture of a typical day. Questions about salary, vacations, and benefits gener-
ally should be asked after you have received an offer, although for certain
positions it may be appropriate to ask these questions during the interview,
particularly if the interviewer brings these topics up.
```
```
UÊ Bring extra copies of your résumé and other supporting documents, in case
the interviewer does not have easy access to these materials or wishes to
share your résumé with someone else in the organization.
```
During the Interview

So, your interview day has arrived. Here are some suggestions for how to make the
most of it:

```
UÊ Under no circumstances should you be late. Give yourself enough time to
get to the interview and arrive a bit early. If you are unfamiliar with where
the interview is being held, make sure to visit the site the previous day so
you know how to get there.
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
UÊ Your appearance is important. Make sure that you are dressed attractively
and that your hair is neat. Note that appropriate attire for one job interview
may be quite inappropriate for another type of job. If you’re not sure what
to wear, err on the side of dressing in a more conservative and professional
manner.
```
```
UÊ Remember to use some of the strategies discussed earlier in this chapter. For
example, really listen to what the interviewer asks or tells you. Pay attention
to your nonverbal communication and try to maintain eye contact.
```
```
UÊ Be courteous, polite, and tactful. Remember to say please and thank-you.
Don’t disparage the organization, the interview process, or the person inter-
viewing you. In fact, avoid appearing overly negative about previous jobs
and employers, even if you were unhappy in a previous position.
```
```
UÊ Appear flexible and willing to compromise. For example, if the hours aren’t
perfect, let the interviewer know that you will do what you can to accom-
modate the schedule. After you get the offer, you can renegotiate the hours.
If it doesn’t work out to your satisfaction, you can always turn down the
position.
```
```
UÊ Ask questions. A job interview has two purposes: (1) to allow the interviewer
to decide about you and (2) to give you an opportunity to decide whether
you want to work for that particular organization. Make sure you ask ques-
tions during the interview. Not only will asking questions help you to find
out more about the position, but it will also convey to the interviewer that
you are serious about the job.
```
```
UÊ In general, be yourself during the interview and answer questions hon-
estly. However, don’t offer too much unnecessary personal information. For
example, if the interviewer asks whether you are nervous, it’s okay to say that
you are feeling a bit anxious. On the other hand, there is no need to provide
details about any personal difficulties or stresses that you may be experienc-
ing, including frequent panic attacks, depression, or marital problems.
```
```
UÊ At the end of your interview, ask the interviewer what the next steps are.
For example, if the organization will be interviewing other candidates, when
can you expect to hear their decision? Is there likely to be a second or third
interview for the finalists?
```
After the Interview

Your work isn’t quite over once the interview ends. Here are a couple of suggestions
for things to do after the interview has ended:


```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
UÊ After the interview, send a letter thanking the interviewer for his or her
time.
```
```
UÊ Take some time to think about what went well during the interview and
what you might have preferred to do or say differently. This information will
be helpful for planning your next set of interviews if you don’t get the job.
```
ASSERTIVE COMMUNICATION

This section describes three ways of communicating: passive communication, aggressive
communication, and assertive communication. Passive and aggressive styles of commu-
nication rarely have the desired effect; assertive communication is more likely to get
positive results. This section will help you to understand the differences among these
three types of communication and will provide you with an introduction to methods for
ensuring that you communicate assertively.

Passive Communication

Generally, shyness and social anxiety are associated with a tendency to communicate
passively. Passive communication involves expressing one’s needs indirectly, often in a
quiet voice, and perhaps with frequent pauses and hesitations. Passive communication
places the other person’s wants, needs, and desires ahead of your own. This style of com-
municating is often associated with a strong desire to avoid any possibility of offending
or inconveniencing the other individual. However, because your message is not commu-
nicated directly, the other person may never receive the message that you intended to
communicate. Therefore, passive communication closes the channels of communication
and may cause you to feel hurt and resentful. In fact, this resentment eventually may put
you at risk for communicating in an aggressive manner later on. For example, a passive
way of inviting someone to socialize is the vague statement, “We should get together
sometime.”

Aggressive Communication

Aggressive communication involves expressing your feelings, needs, or wants at the
expense of another’s feelings, needs, and wants. Aggressive communication tends to be
judgmental, critical, and accusatory in content and tone. Like passive communication,
this style of responding closes the channels of communication and can result in hurt feel-
ings, grudges, anger, and alienation from the other person. An example of an aggressive
way of asking someone to socialize is the statement, “If you cared about me and weren’t
so selfish, you would invite me to get together with you more often.”


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Assertive Communication

Often, people assume that passive and aggressive styles of communicating are their
only two options. However, there is a third option. In contrast to aggressive and passive
styles of communicating, assertive communication takes into account one’s own feelings,
needs, and wants, as well as those of the other person. Assertive communication has
many of the features of good communication, including a tendency to be direct, clear,
and immediate. An example of an assertive way to invite someone to socialize is the
question, “Would you like to see a movie with me this weekend?”
In addition, assertive communication should include actively listening to the other
person’s perspective (including trying to hear and understand the other person’s point of
view, validating the other person’s feelings, asking for clarification, and so on). Although
assertive communication does not guarantee that you will get your way, compared with
aggressive and passive styles of communication, assertive statements are more likely to
keep the channels of communication open and to maximize the chances of reaching a
mutually satisfactory resolution.

Dealing Assertively with Conflict Situations

If your goal is to convince someone else to change his or her behavior, an appropri-
ate way of doing that is to make sure that your message is neither passive nor aggressive.
Instead, you should try to communicate your message in a way that is factual, direct,
and empathic.
Begin by describing your observations regarding the situation. Observations reflect
your perspective regarding the facts, rather than your interpretations of those facts.
Observations should be based on reality and therefore are usually very difficult to argue
with. For example, “You arrived home too late” is not an observation because whether
the person’s arrival is “too” late is open to interpretation. However, the statement “You
arrived home an hour later than you said you would” is an observation (assuming it’s
true) and is therefore less likely to lead to a defensive response from the other person.
After describing your observations, the next step is to describe your feelings about
the situation. Feelings are emotions such as anger, anxiety, worry, and sadness. Feelings
are not thoughts. For example, the statement “I feel that you should not be late” is not
really a feeling statement. In contrast, “I feel hurt and worried when you arrive home
later than you say you will” is a feeling statement. As is the case with communicating
your observations, it’s difficult to argue with a feeling statement. Only you know how
you really feel.
Finally, it is important to communicate the ways in which you would like things to
change. To follow the earlier example through, you might say, “I would like you to phone
me if you are going to be more than thirty minutes late.”


```
Communicating More Effectively
```
After you communicate your message in terms of these three components, you need
to make sure that you give the other person a chance to express his or her perspective
on the situation. Make sure you take advantage of the active listening skills that were
discussed earlier in this chapter.
In addition to these basic assertiveness skills, there are a number of other strategies
that may help you to deal with conflict situations:

```
UÊ Make sure that you choose an appropriate time to talk about the situation.
Don’t put it off indefinitely. On the other hand, don’t talk about the issue
during the height of your anger. Also, don’t insist that the issue be discussed
right away if the other person is busy or unwilling to talk. Sometimes it’s
best to schedule a meeting at a mutually convenient time and to discuss the
matter then.
```
```
UÊ Make sure that you challenge the beliefs that contribute to your anxiety,
anger, or hurt feelings. As discussed in chapter 6, our feelings are influenced
by our beliefs, and our beliefs may be exaggerated or unrealistic at times.
In other words, the situation may not matter as much as you think it does.
When discussing the situation with the other person, try to maintain your
cool by thinking about the situation realistically.
```
```
UÊ Before confronting a situation, decide whether it is worth it. Is it a situation
that matters? Will it take care of itself, even if you don’t say anything? For
example, if your difficult neighbor is moving away next week, perhaps it’s
not important to complain about the way he or she maintains the lawn.
```
```
UÊ Try bouncing your thoughts off a neutral third party. Hearing another per-
son’s views regarding the issue may help you to see things in a different
way. This can be particularly useful to determine whether your expectations
about the situation are distorted.
```
```
UÊ Try to understand the other person’s perspective. Like you, the other indi-
vidual is just trying to survive the best way that he or she can. Hostility
and anger often are triggered by feelings of threat or hurt. If you develop an
empathic understanding of the other person’s perspective and beliefs, you
will have a greater chance of finding a compromise and resolving the con-
flict, particularly if the other person can see that you are genuinely trying
to understand.
```
```
UÊ Consider writing a letter to the other person. Sometimes it’s easier to com-
municate your thoughts and feelings in writing. However, even in a letter,
you should use an assertive communication style rather than a passive or
aggressive one. It is usually best not to use e-mail in these situations.

MEETING NEW PEOPLE, MAKING FRIENDS,

AND DATING

This section describes ways of improving the skills that are important for meeting
new people and developing new relationships. The topics covered include suggestions
for where to meet new people and ways to deal with certain stresses associated with
developing relationships, such as the possibility of being rejected.

Places to Meet New People

In a survey of more than 3,000 Americans, Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, and Michaels
(1994) studied the ways and places in which people meet. Among married people, the
ways that individuals met their spouses are shown by percentages as follows:

```
Way of Meeting Percent*
Introduction by a friend 3 5%
Introduction by self 3 2%
Introduction by a family member 1 5%
Introduction by a coworker 6 %
Introduction by a classmate 6 %
Introduction by someone else 2 %
Introduction by a neighbor 1 %
```
*Note: The numbers do not add up to 100 percent because a small number of people gave multiple
answers.

In the same survey, the places where married individuals met their spouses were
broken down into percentages as follows:

```
Location of Meeting Percent
School 23%
Work 15%
Party 10%
Place of worship (e.g., church) 8 %
Bar 8 %
Gym or social club 4 %
Personal ad 1 %
Vacation 1%
Elsewhere 30%
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
The statistics were similar for people in unmarried partnerships (couples cohabit-
ing, couples in long-term partnerships, and couples in short-term partnerships), although
some of the numbers were different in these other groups. For example, compared with
married people, unmarried people in short-term relationships were more likely to have
met their partners at a bar (17 percent) or a party (25 percent) and less likely to have
met them at a place of worship (1 percent). Note that this survey was conducted before
the Internet boom, so it doesn’t include information about online dating. We will return
to this topic shortly.
There are many other locations where it can be relatively easy to develop new
friendships or to meet a potential partner. Some examples include the following: through
a hobby (for example, joining a photography club or a theater group), getting involved in
a sport (joining a bowling league, a running club, or a hiking group), getting in shape (for
instance, lifting weights in a gym, joining an aerobics class, taking swimming lessons),
taking dance classes, volunteering for an organization, forming a book club or reading
group, attending public lectures, taking a part-time job, enrolling in an adult education
course, or traveling (perhaps with a group).
The best way to meet new people is to do the things that you enjoy doing. That
way, you are likely to meet people who enjoy the same things you do. For example, if
you don’t enjoy drinking alcohol or spending time in bars, you should think twice about
trying to meet people there. At a bar, you are likely to meet people who enjoy going to
bars. You should also keep in mind the types of people you are likely to meet by getting
involved in a particular activity. For example, if you want to meet people close to your
own age, try to get involved in activities that attract people in your age group.
It’s not enough just to be around other people. To meet them, it will be necessary
to take social risks in the situation. For openers, you should maintain eye contact, make
a point of saying hello, and be sure to smile from time to time. Casual contact is more
likely to develop into a friendship or relationship if you purposely engage in conversa-
tion. As you get to know someone, you will need to take bigger risks such as asking that
person to meet you for coffee, go to a movie, or join you for a day’s outing to a park or
a museum.

Meeting People Online

Internet dating is a very popular way to meet people. _The Internet Dating Guide_ (www
.theinternetdatingguide.com) reports that about 30 percent of American singles
have used matchmaking sites. According to _Online Dating Magazine_ (www.onlinedating
magazine.com), twenty million Americans visit an online dating service each month,
120,000 marriages per year occur as a result of an online dating service, and about a
third of Americans know someone who has used an online dating service. The Internet is
also a great source of information about ways for singles to meet. Simply enter the name
of your city and the word “singles” into a search engine (for example, Google), and you


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

will likely come up with all sorts of ideas, ranging from “speed dating” groups to singles
travel opportunities, personal ad listings, and social events.
In addition to online dating, the Internet is a popular way to meet new friends.
An anonymous survey of 191 college students (Knox et al. 2001) found that friendship
(as opposed to dating) was the most important reason for using the Internet among
this group. In this survey, 60 percent of respondents reported that they had success-
fully established an online friendship, and about half reported being more comfortable
meeting people online than in person. However, note that 40 percent of people reported
having lied online! More recently, online social networking sites like Facebook.com and
MySpace_._ com have become popular ways to meet friends.
It is important for you not to use online relationships as a replacement for in-person
relationships. Rather, you should view online relationships as a stepping stone toward
meeting people in person. The recommended readings section at the end of the book
provides additional resources on online dating.

Dating Skills

Regardless of how it may seem, there are lots of potential partners out there, regard-
less of whether you are old or young, male or female. Furthermore, the idea that there
is only one person out there who is your soul mate is a myth. There are many different
people who are potentially excellent partners, each having very different qualities to
bring to a relationship. Although it may sound like a cliché, it is often true that someone
comes along when you least expect it, and often it occurs when you’re not even looking.
So relax. Rushing the process can lead to feelings of disappointment or failure when a
hoped-for relationship doesn’t work out. There are several excellent published guides
to dating, a number of which are listed in the recommended readings at the end of the
book.

```
PREPARATION
```
The first step in dating is preparation. What does preparation in this context mean?
It means you figure out what you’re looking for. What is the purpose of your search?
Are you looking for a serious relationship, marriage, and children? Or are you looking
for a sexual partner? Companionship? A way to alleviate boredom? The purpose of the
relationship will influence what kind of person you will seek and attract. For example, if
you are looking for excitement, meeting someone who is aloof, mysterious, and gorgeous
may be your aim. On the other hand, if you want a more serious relationship, you should
choose to emphasize qualities that will continue to be important to you after the thrill
of a new relationship wears off, like a sense of humor, shared values, kindness, honesty,
stability, responsibility, and respect.
Despite the saying “opposites attract,” the cliché “birds of a feather flock together”
is probably closer to the truth. Generally, research in social psychology has found that


```
Communicating More Effectively
```
people are most attracted to those who are similar to them with respect to values, appear-
ance, interests, and other attributes. Being aware of your own interests and attributes will
help you to know what you are looking for in another person. In addition, _being_ the type
of person who you would like to meet will help you to attract that person. To meet the
right person, you need to make a point of being in places where that person is likely to
be. For example, if you’re interested in meeting someone who loves reading, then make a
point of spending time in the library, visiting bookstores, or attending book signings.

```
NETWORKING
```
One very helpful activity for meeting new people is called networking. _Networking_
can be defined as an exchange of information or services among individuals or groups.
As we mentioned earlier, more than two thirds of married people are introduced to their
spouses by a third person (Laumann et al. 1994). Therefore, let your friends and family
know that you are interested in meeting someone. If nothing romantic develops, you may
add to your circle of friends. By adding new friends (without actually giving up on old
friendships), you will increase your chances of finding a partner.

```
FIRST DATES
```
When you do meet someone who interests you, the initial date can be quite infor-
mal. For example, you might go for a walk during a break at work, run an errand together
between classes, or offer the person a ride home. After you’ve had more contact with
the person, you could suggest a more formal outing, like going out for lunch or dinner,
seeing a concert or movie, or visiting a gallery or museum. If you are a student, you
might suggest taking a class with the other person to increase your chances of having
repeated contact.
On your date, pay attention to small details, especially your physical appearance and
hygiene. Dress appropriately for the situation. Wear clothes you like, but err on the side
of conservative or classic fashions if you are unsure about the other person’s taste. In
other words, don’t wear your most outrageous outfit on a first date.

```
REJECTION
```
Be prepared for rejection. Much more often than not, a particular dating situation
does not lead to a long-term relationship. It’s normal for one person to be more inter-
ested in pursuing a relationship than the other person is. If the other individual ends
up not wanting to continue the relationship, make sure that you keep the rejection in
perspective (see chapter 6 for suggestions). A rejection does not mean that there is
something wrong with you or that going out on dates will never lead to a long-term
relationship. Rather, rejection speaks more to the fit between you and the specific person
with whom things didn’t work out. Experiencing some form of rejection is a necessary
part of dating. The more dating experiences you seek out, the more rejection you will


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

experience. However, increasing the frequency of your dates will also provide opportu-
nities to improve your dating skills and increase the likelihood of developing a positive
relationship in the future.

PRESENTATIONS AND PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILLS

This section provides a basic primer on public speaking and giving presentations. In
particular, it includes suggestions for preparing for presentations or talks and describes
ways to improve the quality of your presentations.
For a more detailed treatment of this topic, we suggest that you check out the rec-
ommended readings on public speaking at the end of this book. Although the emphasis
in most of these books is on business presentations, many of the skills suggested apply
to other types of presentations as well, such as giving a speech at a wedding or party. In
addition to providing suggestions for how to organize and deliver presentations, most of
these recommended books also provide ideas for managing anxiety during presentations.
One that provides an excellent mix of information on presentation skills and managing
anxiety is _The Confident Speaker: Beat Your Nerves and Communicate at Your Best in Any Situation_
(Monarth and Kase 2007).

Preparing for Presentations

Preparing for presentations involves seven important steps: (1) identifying the
purpose of the presentation, (2) determining the nature of the audience, (3) deciding
upon the subject matter, (4) organizing the presentation, (5) making your talk interesting
and compiling supporting materials, (6) rehearsing the presentation, and (7) managing
your anxiety.

```
STEP 1: DETERMINING THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENTATION
```
Before preparing a lecture or speech, you must first be clear about the purpose
of the presentation. Essentially, presentations can have one or more of the following
functions:

```
UÊ To persuade. For example, a presentation may be designed to sell a particu-
lar product or to convince a group of coworkers to change a procedure in
the workplace.
```
```
UÊ To explain. Examples include a half-day orientation meeting to explain
company procedures to new employees, a lecture designed to teach a complex
topic to college students, or a seminar to provide in-depth information to
colleagues about a particular subject.
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
UÊ To instruct. These may include presentations regarding how to perform a
task (like how to use a new computer program) or how to develop a new
skill (for example, learning to dance).
```
```
UÊ To brief. Some presentations are designed to brief an audience regarding
some matter. For example, this may include a four-minute presentation to
update management about the status of union negotiations or to brief your
customers about changes in the price of a product.
```
```
UÊ To entertain. Examples of presentations designed to entertain include theat-
rical presentations (for instance, stand-up comedy) and sometimes speeches
at weddings, anniversaries, or parties.
```
```
STEP 2: DETERMINING THE NATURE OF THE AUDIENCE
```
Before planning a presentation in detail, it is helpful to know something about the
nature of your audience. In some cases, you may even need to ask the audience questions
about their background at the start of the presentation and adapt your style or content
to meet their needs. Some questions that are helpful to consider include the following:

```
UÊ How big is the audience?
```
```
UÊ What is the likely composition of the audience (factors such as age, gender,
professional background)?
```
```
UÊ What is the audience expecting?
```
```
UÊ How much does the audience already know? What do they still need to
learn?
```
```
UÊ Why is the audience attending the presentation—because they have to or
because they want to?
```
```
STEP 3: DECIDING UPON THE SUBJECT MATTER
```
Before giving your presentation, you should have an idea of the main message that
you want to convey. In most cases, the main point of the presentation should be simple
and clear. The audience should be aware of the key points that you plan to make so that
the content of the presentation can be understood in the proper context. In most cases,
it’s helpful to pique the group’s interest (perhaps with a joke, anecdote, or illustration)
early in the talk. If the purpose of your presentation is to persuade the audience about
some issue, you should ensure that you have gained their confidence (for example, by
making the members of the audience aware of your expertise and credentials). Also,
persuasive presentation should include specific instructions on how to implement the
suggestions you provide (for example, where to obtain the product you are selling).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
STEP 4: ORGANIZING THE PRESENTATION
```
One of the most common suggestions made to people who prepare presentations is
to pay close attention to the three phases of the talk: the introduction, the main body
of the talk, and the conclusion. The _introduction_ should include an overview of the pre-
sentation so audience members know what to expect. The _main body_ of the presentation
is where you discuss the main content of the talk, with all of the important details. At
the _conclusion_ , you should provide a brief summary, as well as some interpretations and
inferences about the content (for instance, why the presentation was important).
If possible, your presentation should be organized so it tells a story. For example,
before describing a new method of performing some task, you might provide the audi-
ence with a history of how that particular task has been performed in the past so they
have a context in which to understand the new information. Or, the presentation can
be laid out so that a series of problems are described, each followed by one or more
solutions.

```
STEP 5: MAKING THE PRESENTATION INTERESTING
```
In addition to making sure your main points are conveyed to the audience, it is
important that they are conveyed in a way that is interesting. To help you do this,
consider strategies like humor, analogies, personal stories, examples, illustrations, and
relevant statistics. Be careful not to use humor that could offend audience members.
You never know who is in your audience and whether their backgrounds, beliefs, or
experiences might cause them to take a joke the wrong way. Another strategy is to
involve the audience members in some way. For example, you might ask them questions
or encourage them to ask you questions during your presentation. Or you could have
them do something (demonstrate the skill you are trying to teach, complete a survey
or take a test, and so on). Supporting materials can be another useful way to bring your
presentation to life.

**Supporting materials.** Supporting materials often take the form of visuals (for example,
PowerPoint slides and other projected images, videos, white boards, flip charts, CD
ROMs, and so on). These visuals can include text, photos, illustrations, cartoons, graphics,
and maps. Here are a few suggestions to keep in mind regarding supporting materials:

```
UÊ If you are going to use cartoons, make sure they are funny. Ask some
friends, family members, or coworkers for their opinions about the cartoons
you intend to use.
```
```
UÊ In some cases, it may be helpful to have props. For example, if you mention
particular books in your presentation, have copies with you for audience
members to look at. If you are describing a product, bring it with you and
display it during the presentation.
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
UÊ If possible, provide handouts containing copies of your slides and overheads
so that audience members can listen to you instead of having to take notes.
Audience members generally appreciate getting handouts.
```
```
UÊ Make sure that your slides and overheads are attractive and that the type is
large enough to be seen from the back of the room.
```
```
UÊ Avoid the temptation to have too much information on your slides and
overheads.
```
```
STEP 6: REHEARSING THE PRESENTATION
```
If at all possible, rehearse your presentation beforehand. There are several ways
of rehearsing. Ideally, you can rehearse in front of an audience of friends, family, or
coworkers, preferably in a location similar to where the actual talk will be held. Ask your
rehearsal audience for feedback, and make changes to the presentation accordingly. If
you cannot rehearse in front of a live audience, try rehearsing in front of a video camera
or camcorder and watch the recording afterward. If that’s not possible, practice out loud
in front of a mirror. As you become more experienced in giving presentations, practicing
beforehand will become less important.

```
STEP 7: MANAGING YOUR ANXIETY
```
Preparing for a presentation should also include strategies for managing your anxiety.
Before the presentation, make sure that you have used the cognitive strategies (chapter
6) to challenge your anxious thoughts. In addition, use the exposure-based strategies
(chapters 7 through 9) to confront your fears whenever possible. When you’re actu-
ally in the situation, make sure that your breathing is slow and regular. Overbreathing
or holding your breath will increase your anxiety symptoms. Don’t fight your fear. Just
let the symptoms happen. Fighting your fear is likely to cause anxiety symptoms to
intensify. It’s okay to be nervous during a presentation. In fact, audience members often
expect it. Depending on the nature of the presentation, it may even be helpful to tell
the audience you are feeling nervous. Saying so may help you to calm down, and it very
likely will help to win the audience over to your side.

Delivering the Presentation

```
Here is a list of suggestions to keep in mind when you are giving a presentation.
```
```
UÊ Pay attention to the way you deliver your speech. Before the talk, check
any pronunciations you’re not sure about. Make sure that your voice does
not drop off at the end of your sentences. Be sure you are projecting at a
reasonable volume (imagine you are delivering your speech to the back wall
```

The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

```
of the room). Speak crisply and pronounce your words clearly. Avoid saying
“uh” and “um.” Finally, avoid speaking too quickly. Going too fast is one of
the most common mistakes people make during presentations, particularly
when they are feeling anxious.
```
```
UÊ Make eye contact with the audience members during the talk.
```
```
UÊ Try to move around when you are speaking. Walk around the front of the
room rather than staying planted at a podium. Don’t put your hands in
your pockets. Instead, gesture with your hands to emphasize key points.
However, keep your hands away from your face and hair.
```
```
UÊ Presentations are often less interesting when they are read verbatim. If you
read a presentation word for word, you also run the risk of panicking if you
lose your place. Instead, we recommend speaking from a detailed outline
with lots of headings, bullets, and so on. An outline will make sure that all
the information you need is available and easy to access, even if you lose
your place. It will also force you to be somewhat spontaneous during the
presentation. If the thought of not reading your speech is too scary, another
option is to bring both an outline version and a fully written version. If
necessary, you can switch to reading your presentation if using the outline
alone doesn’t work.
```
```
UÊ Don’t talk down to your audience. They probably know more than you
think they do. Even if the material is new to them, they will not appreciate
being talked to like children—unless, of course, they are children! Make
sure your tone of voice and the things you say are not condescending.
```
```
UÊ Repeat the main points of the presentation frequently. Audience members
will not hear everything you say, and if they miss an important point you
may lose them for the rest of the presentation unless the important points
are repeated.
```
```
UÊ Keep it simple. Don’t try to discuss more than your time allows.
```
```
UÊ Make sure you are prepared to handle questions. Consider bringing addi-
tional information (a reference book, notes, and so on) that may be needed
to answer certain types of questions. No matter how silly a question is, try
to answer it tactfully and show respect for the person who asked the ques-
tion (for example, “That’s an interesting question.. .”). Finally, repeat all
audience questions before you answer them. Chances are good that people
in the back of the room will not be able to hear some of the questions the
first time they are asked.
```

```
Communicating More Effectively
```
```
UÊ Be yourself during the talk. Audiences prefer a speaker who is down to earth
and genuine rather than someone who looks as if he or she is trying too hard
to be entertaining or to impress the audience.
```
After the Presentation

Following your presentation, it is helpful to evaluate the quality of your performance,
basing your evaluation on whether you followed the suggestions provided in this chapter.
Don’t base your self-evaluation on whether you were anxious during the presentation or
whether your anxiety symptoms showed. The presenter’s anxiety or lack thereof is only
one small aspect of what makes an effective presentation.
Social anxiety is associated with the tendency to be an overly harsh critic of one’s
own performance. Therefore, we suggest that you obtain objective feedback from your
audience members as well. This can be done informally by asking people what they
thought of the talk. Or, if appropriate, it can be done more formally by handing out an
anonymous evaluation form that requires audience members to rate their impressions of
certain aspects of the presentation, such as the format of the presentation, the content
(for example, interest level, relevance, difficulty, and so on), the speaker (for example,
presentation skills, organization, expertise, clarity), use of audiovisual resources, and the
location (for instance, lighting, temperature, seating comfort). In addition, make sure to
include space on the form for audience members to write their impressions (strengths of
the presentation, areas for improvement) in their own words.



CHAPTER 11

### Maintaining Your

### Improvements and

### Planning for the Future

The purpose of this final chapter is to discuss strategies for ensuring that the gains you
have made so far are maintained over the coming months and years. Perhaps the most
important suggestion we can offer is that you should continue to use the strategies
described in the first ten chapters. Continuing to use approaches that were helpful in
getting you to where you are now will ensure that you maintain your gains and that your
anxiety continues to decrease over time.

THE END OF TREATMENT

In some ways, treatment is never finished. Although most people experience improvements
using the strategies described in this book, it’s common for people to continue to suffer
from anxiety in some social situations from time to time. Like back pain, depression, and
high blood pressure, anxiety is often a chronic problem that comes and goes, but it can
also be controlled. It will be helpful for you to continue to use the methods described in
this book to make sure that your anxiety doesn’t worsen. In fact, an important goal of
cognitive behavioral therapy is to teach people to be their own therapists. If this book
has been effective, chances are that your anxiety is much better than it was and you have
learned some strategies that you can continue to use as you move forward.


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

If treatment has been less effective than you would have liked, this is a time to figure
out why. Here are some possible reasons to consider:

```
UÊ Inadequate dosage. Typically, we think of dosage in the context of medica-
tion treatments, and certainly an inadequate dosage of medication (taking
too little medication or taking medication for too short a time) can lead to
a lack of improvement. However, the term “dosage” can also be applied
to cognitive behavioral strategies. There is evidence that improvement is
directly related to the amount of homework a person completes. So, if your
exposure practices are too short or too infrequent or you don’t practice
challenging your anxiety-provoking thoughts, your anxiety may not have
improved as much as you had hoped.
```
```
UÊ Stress. If you were under a lot of stress while working on the strategies in
this book, you may have found only limited benefit. For example, if you
were working very long hours, dealing with family stresses, or coping with
serious health problems, you may not have been able to devote as much
time to this treatment as you might have liked. Our recommendation is to
try again once the stress in your life has subsided. Stress can also lead to a
return of fear, an issue to which we will return shortly.
```
```
UÊ Other psychological problems. In some cases, shyness and social anxiety
are part of another problem. For example, someone with an eating disor-
der may have high levels of social anxiety for fear of looking fat in front
of others. Although the strategies in this book may help in such a case, it
would also be important to directly address the eating issues.
```
```
UÊ Other life issues. For some people, years of social anxiety can lead to
various long-term problems, including chronic unemployment, extreme
loneliness, severe depression, or substance-use problems. Without address-
ing these larger issues, the strategies described in this book may not have
much impact on improving your overall quality of life. It will be important
to find some help and support for these larger issues as well. Chapter 4
includes some recommendations for finding a therapist. Professional help
may be able to steer you in a direction toward solving these other problems
in addition to your anxiety.
```
WHY FEAR RETURNS AND WHAT YOU

CAN DO ABOUT IT

Most people who receive treatment for social anxiety experience long-lasting improve-
ments in their anxiety, particularly following cognitive and behavioral treatment.


```
Maintaining Your Improvements and Planning for the Future
```
Nevertheless, there are a number of different reasons why fear may return for some
individuals. If your fear returns, the best thing to do is to resume using the strategies
that were most helpful to you the first time you overcame your fear. Social anxiety that
comes back sometime after a period of improvement may even be easier to overcome
the second time around.

```
Discontinuing the Treatment Strategies Too Early
or Too Quickly
```
Discontinuing your cognitive therapy and exposure practices may increase the like-
lihood of experiencing a return of fear, particularly if you stop using these techniques
before you have completely overcome your anxiety. We recommend that you continue
to challenge your anxiety-provoking thoughts from time to time for as long as you con-
tinue to feel anxious. When your fear has decreased significantly, you can stop using
the cognitive diaries. However, you should continue to use the cognitive techniques
informally, by silently asking yourself appropriate questions (for example, “Is there some
other, nonanxious way of interpreting this situation?”).
In addition, you should take advantage of opportunities to expose yourself to previ-
ously feared situations even after your fear has been reduced. Sometimes life circum-
stances (such as being busy at work or school, or recovering from the flu) make it hard
to practice exposure on a regular basis. Whenever possible, continue to confront your
feared situations from time to time. Occasional exposures should help to prevent your
fear from returning.
Stopping medication too early may also increase the risk of your anxiety returning.
As discussed in chapter 5, relapse following discontinuation from treatment with antide-
pressants is believed to be less likely when treatment has continued for at least a year. So,
it’s best not to stop medication treatment the moment you start to feel better.
Coming off medication suddenly may also increase the risk of your fear returning.
Discontinuation from some antidepressants and from almost all anti-anxiety medications
is associated with symptoms of withdrawal, which often mimic the symptoms of anxiety.
These withdrawal symptoms may prompt some people to resume their old habits of
avoidance and fearful thinking. The best way of preventing withdrawal symptoms fol-
lowing discontinuation from medication is to reduce the dosage very slowly over time.
We strongly recommend that you not reduce or stop your medication without first
consulting with your doctor.

Life Stresses

Sometimes, an increase in the stress in your life can lead to a return of anxiety
and fear. For example, if you experience a stressful life event (increased hours at work,


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

relationship problems, financial difficulties, health problems, family tensions, death of a
close friend, and the like), you may find that your anxiety in social situations gets worse.
Sometimes, this worsening of anxiety occurs while the stress is ongoing; other times it
may occur shortly after the stress has ended.
The relationship between stress and increased social anxiety is not surprising. Most
people respond to stress in characteristic ways. Some tend to respond physically by
experiencing more colds, headaches, increased blood pressure, and other physical ail-
ments. Others may fall into bad habits, such as smoking more, increasing alcohol or caf-
feine consumption, eating unhealthy foods, or exercising less. Still others may respond
emotionally by becoming more anxious, depressed, or irritable. If your natural pattern
has been to experience anxiety in social situations, stress may cause some of your old
responses to resurface.
Stress tends to increase a person’s arousal level, so breathing becomes heavier, heart
rate increases, and other symptoms of arousal become more intense. When you’re under
stress, it doesn’t take much change in your anxiety level for the feeling to become more
noticeable than usual. Situations that are normally okay may seem overwhelming when
you are experiencing other stresses in your life.
Most of the time, the increase in social anxiety following stress is temporary; when
the stress level improves, the anxiety decreases again. However, if you respond to your
increased anxiety by falling back into your old habits of anxious thinking and avoidance
behaviors, you may find that the increased social anxiety continues even after the stress
has passed. If your anxiety returns following a stressful life event, the best thing to do is
to reread the relevant sections of this book and resume using some of the strategies that
you found helpful the first time around.

Encountering a New and Unexpectedly Difficult Situation

Although you may think you have overcome a particular fear, it is possible that some
fear remains but that you just haven’t had a chance to encounter a sufficiently challeng-
ing situation until now. One of our clients was recently surprised to experience intense
fear while unexpectedly having to give a toast at his father’s birthday party. He had
worked very hard to overcome his fear of public speaking at work. After a few months
of practice, he found he could speak comfortably in meetings, and he even gave long
presentations to groups of 200 or more with almost no fear. One day, he was asked on
the spur of the moment to make a toast at his father’s birthday party to about thirty
friends and relatives whom he had known his whole life. This made him very nervous.
Although he had successfully overcome his fear of speaking in formal work situations,
he had never had the opportunity to speak in an informal and personal situation like a
family party. For him, giving a toast in front of friends and relatives was actually a new
situation that he hadn’t had the chance to practice previously.


```
Maintaining Your Improvements and Planning for the Future
```
Experiencing a Trauma in the Feared Situation

Sometimes, experiencing a trauma in a social situation can lead to a return of fear.
For example, if your audience during a presentation is particularly cold and unfriendly,
if you are rejected by someone whom you care about, or if your boss is extremely criti-
cal of your performance in a meeting, you may find that you’re more anxious the next
time you return to the situation. The fact that you had a particular anxiety in the past
makes it more likely that it will return if you experience a negative event in a situation
that mirrors this old fear.
If you experience a negative event in a situation that you previously feared, the best
thing to do is to return to the situation as soon as possible. If you begin to avoid the
situation, your anxiety will be more likely to return. In addition to exposure, try chal-
lenging your anxious beliefs by considering alternative, nonanxious interpretations of the
negative event you experienced.

PREVENTING YOUR FEAR FROM RETURNING

Although your anxiety is unlikely to return after you have learned to be more comfort-
able in social and performance situations, there are no guarantees. Nevertheless, there
are a number of things that you can do to improve your chances of maintaining your
gains.

```
Continue to Use the Cognitive Therapy and Exposure
Strategies
```
As we’ve discussed, continuing to challenge your anxious thoughts informally and
to practice exposure from time to time will help you to maintain the improvements that
you have made so far. We also recommend that you reread relevant sections from this
book occasionally to reinforce what you have learned and to make sure that you haven’t
forgotten any important principles.

Practice Exposure in a Range of Situations and Contexts

Your gains are likely to last longer if you practice exposure in a wide variety of situ-
ations and contexts. For example, if you’re fearful of starting conversations, rather than
practicing starting conversations only at work, we recommend that you practice making
conversation in other situations as well (for example, at home, at parties, at the bus stop,
in the elevator, and so on).


The Shyness & Social Anxiety Workbook

Take Advantage of Opportunities to Overlearn

_Overlearning_ involves (1) practicing exposure so many times that it becomes boring
and second nature, and (2) practicing exposure in situations more difficult than those
you encounter in your everyday life. For example, if you are fearful of having your hands
shake while having a drink, you can practice having them shake so much that you actu-
ally spill some of your drink. (Make sure your glass is filled with water and not grape
juice!) Repeat this practice until it no longer causes anxiety. Or, if you’re fearful of
making a minor mistake when talking to a stranger, you can practice purposely making
obvious mistakes while speaking to people you don’t know.
Overlearning is thought to offer protection from experiencing a return of fear. There
are several advantages of practicing exposure to more difficult situations than those you
normally encounter. First, practicing in more challenging situations will automatically
make the less challenging situations seem easier. Second, practices in difficult situa-
tions will further challenge your anxious beliefs. For example, if you learn that nothing
bad happens even if you purposely make a big mistake during a presentation, you may
become less fearful of accidentally making a small mistake when speaking in public.
Finally, overlearning provides room for some of your fear to return without causing
significant impairment in your life.

WHERE TO GO FOR MORE INFORMATION

For those who want additional information on social anxiety and related topics, we have
included more useful information at the back of this book. Our list of recommended
readings includes books on social anxiety, other anxiety problems, cognitive behavioral
therapy, and related topics. This list also includes information on two videos on the
treatment of social anxiety. Readings are included both for consumers and profession-
als. We have also included a resource list of national and international organizations that
provide information (including referrals to experienced therapists) to people who suffer
from social anxiety and for professionals who have an interest in this topic. Finally, we
have included a list of websites that provide information on social anxiety and effective
treatments.
We hope that you have found the strategies described in this book helpful. Chances
are that you will need to continue to use these tools for some time before experiencing
a reduction in social anxiety that has a noticeable impact on your day-to-day life. We
recommend that you reread the sections that were particularly useful or inspiring to you.
Most of all, we wish you good luck as you learn to deal with stressful social situations
with a new, well-earned sense of confidence.

Recent studies suggest that approximately 7% of Americans suffer from
social anxiety disorder. In addition to the high percentage of people with
symptoms meeting criteria for this disorder, many other individuals
experience social anxiety or shyness to a lesser, but still impairing degree.
Practitioners are likely to encounter patients displaying some degree of
social anxiety, no matter what specialty service or setting they occupy.
Over the past 20 years, effective tools have been developed to identify
and treat social anxiety. This book provides straightforward, accessible
assessment and treatment information for clinicians and students on
the diagnosis, identifi cation, conceptualization, and treatment of social
anxiety and social phobia.

_“This book fi lls an important gap in the literature – fi lled with clinical examples
and advice, its straightforward presentation will allow clinicians with various
levels of expertise to implement these effi cacious interventions. [The authors]
provide not only a valuable tool for their colleagues, but also hope for the
millions who suffer from SAD.”_
Deborah C. Beidel, PhD, Professor and Director of Clinical Training,

“[The authors] are to be congratulated for putting together a concise, practical,
eminently readable primer on diagnosis and treatment of SAD. Yes, the advice is
evidence-based, but it is also grounded in years of experience treating patients...
It is required reading for any therapist seeking to broaden or sharpen their
expertise in this area.”
